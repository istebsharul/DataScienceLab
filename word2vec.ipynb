This is a beautiful DIPA that could easily be mistaken for an American barleywine. The densely creamy crown looks like orange-caramel mousse and also looks to be full of hop resins due to the impressive amount of glass coverage that has occured so far.  The aroma doesn't ease off the accelerator for one second. Although it's difficult to believe 168 IBUs, I suppose it is possible. In any case, the beer smells like it's chock-a-block full of both caramel malt and C-hops. I get tired of describing DIPAs noses as brown sugar, grapefruit, orange and pine, but that's what's in here. I think I'm gonna like this one.  Mean Manalishi walks a very fine line. On one side of the line is too much caramel malt and on the other is just short of too much caramel malt. To clarify, that's with respect to flavor, not body. Thankfully, it isn't anywhere near the gooey, sticky mess that some DIPAs tend to be.  In spite of the 'toasted bread slathered with melted caramel' flavor of the malt, the 'citrus pith on steroids' flavor of the hops is able to punch through with authority. While those competing (yet complementary) flavors go toe-to-toe, the sweetness of the former is no match for the scathing alpha acid bitterness of the latter. This stuff isn't called *Mean* Manalishi simply because it sounds cool. Which it does.  My wavering on the all-important taste score is now officially over. There's so much juicy, buzzsaw-like hop flavor in every mouthful that I don't know how the final score could ever have been in doubt. There's no question but that MM is Ohio's hoppiest beer. For once, the words 'extreme\", \"assertive' and 'intense' aren't mere marketing malarky.  No alcohol is appreciated. I'm not sure how it could be given wall-to-wall hop resinousness. Drinkability is directly proportional to one's hopheadedness. This bomber is going to obliterate my taste buds for the remainder of the night, but that's a tradeoff that I'm more than willing to make.  The mouthfeel might be a fraction lighter than the style average. That isn't a negative in this case because it keeps things moving smartly along. This is a 'begs to be gulped' beer, not an 'asks to be sipped' beer. The fact that I wouldn't want it any lighter or any heavier is reason enough for the above score.  I continue to be delighted by the deliciousness coming out of Ohio's second best brewery. Mr. Karm creates big beer for big beer lovers and does it exceptionally well. I always make sure to grab a handful of Hoppin' Frog bombers when I get back to the Buckeye State. I might have to make it two handfuls this time. Mean Manalishi means business.\"}\n",

Pours a light root-beer colored amber in a proper Bath Ales pint glass, this baby has a monsterous off white head that looks like an Root Beer-Ice Cream float! And this was from a very slow pour. As the head slowly drops, there is a large amount that remains stuck the side of the glass. Holy cow!  The first sniff was a sweetbread aroma, but a few seconds later it was grassy, weedy, hoppy bitter nose. Overall, not as balanced as it could be. But it lives up the the bitter part of the name. The sweet must have been in the top layer of bubbles only!!!  Flavor is much better balanced. A good solid bitter profile to live up to the style, but the roasty malts lend a very nice contrast. I am enjoying this and it takes me back to the trip. Very nice.  The low ABV allows this to be a session beer (if I was able to get it in the states). I really like it.  EDIT (11/28/05): As I am known to do, I put the bottle aside to save the label, so I did my hot water treatment, and guess what I found? Another label underneath! This beer used to be 'The City Ale- Bath City Football Club Premiere Amber Ale\", \"A rich aroma of hops and malt with a long, deep, and bitter-sweet finish' and 'Best By 25.11.05'. Very interesting. Didn't sell during the football season, so re-label it and sell it to the tourists. Hmmmm...\"}\n",

Dated 06/17/11 08:55.  A: Gorgeous ruby-hued amber, clear as day, with a small eggshell-white head. There is not much head, nor does it show much staying power, but at 12% ABV that's not a surprise. Thin, wispy lacing. This liquid looks as though it is dancing - the name and label artwork are perfect.  S: This thing smells like hoppy Kool-Aid with an alcohol burn...but I mean that in the absolutely best possible way. It's so sweet it's like candy, but with the most glorious hop aroma I have ever experienced. You see aroma and flavor descriptions like 'pineapple\", \"mango', and 'peach' thrown around a lot, and most of the time the description is close (...to a point - more-so as a reference and not a literal 1:1 description.) But in Devil Dancer...it's as though the most perfectly ripe of hand-picked peaches and pineapple and mango were gently crushed, dusted with the lightest bit of sugar, and delicately dipped into this delectable ambrosia. And the alcohol, while certainly apparent, is integrated so well into the thick fog that hovers over this beer that it merely adds yet another dimension of interest. This aroma is 100% unique to Devil Dancer, and it is glorious.  T: The joyous triumphant tears of the heavens were wrung into this bottle. Is this what the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil tasted like? Incredible hop flavors, again, of literal pineapple, mango, papaya, peach, and the sweetest and most bitter of grapefruits mingle and sway in concert with a strong but never imposing malt backbone. The massive bitterness is slowly and dramatically unveiled in the middle of a sip, like the unfurling of a velvet curtain, and it slowly and triumphantly withers in an embrace with the bright and glowing sweetness until only the resplendent wreckage of your palate remains, begging for another adventurous sip.  M: Syrupy, slick, thick, and oily. Mouth-coating and tongue-destroying. Oppressive yet embracing. This is a lover and a fighter, with equal parts of each. The interplay between sweet and bitter, delicate and destructive, delightful and disastrous, is unmatched in my experience. The vapors of alcohol and sheer bitter carnage waft ominously from an open mouth after only a few sips. This beer is both reason and insanity, and it is magnificent.  O: I am no poet, but Devil Dancer inspires more than mere prose. It is masterful in every way, and will inspire and impress whether a few weeks or a few years old, as it will no doubt age with the best of them. Devil Dancer is certainly not for the faint of heart, but if you are truly prepared to dance with the devil, you are in for one spectacular ride.\"}\n",

This year's Nemesis pours a deep black, though not absolute. The faintest ruby highlights come through when the beer is backlit. A finger and a half of khaki head rises up and manages to hang around for a while. The nose has plenty of the dark chocolate and roasted coffee that one might expect from a beer this dark, but there's also an assertive citrus note that integrates itself well. Nemesis 2010 tastes just like it smells. The coffee and dark chocolate flavors greet my palate, before some hop bitterness comes into the picture. That bitterness blends somewhat with the rich coffee notes and offers a brief suggestion of straight espresso. It's also relatively mild for the amount of hop flavor to follow, impressive. To be honest, I expect a beer this big and rich to have a little more body to it, it's a tad thin for a 12% barleywine. Carbonation is a tad low, but very close to being spot on. In a way, the lower than expected body keeps the beer from coming across as syrupy. You'll notice there's no mention of 'alcohol\", \"heat', or 'burn' in this review, and that's because Founders did a masterful job of hiding the alcohol in a very flavorful beer. Definitely better fresh than the inaugural Nemesis.\"}\n",

Kathleen shipped the stray Mr. Moose to me in an empty (!) Wheach box, but given Mr. Moose's state, it may have been full when it was shipped.  From the CAN: 'We love beer.\", \"Riverfront Times 2007 Best Beer in St. Louis' and their website and phone number. 'Hello, CAN you send me some more Wheach? and fill up the rest of the box with Smoke?' I'm like the little piggy on the Geico commercial - Wheee!  Crack & Glug time, if there is to be a review. It never ceases to amaze me what an inverted CAN pour will produce. I got a finger of fluffy, bone-white head with only moderate retention, but it looked nice while it lasted. Color was a cloudy peach-yellow (sorry). Nose was peachy keen, yo! Man, did that take me back. We used to pick peaches in a county orchard when I was but a wee lad and this was what it smelled like!   That reminds me - this beer should be accompanied by 'Peaches' from the Presidents of the USA. Beer is better with music.  I'm back. Mouthfeel was medium with a taste like having run a knife from pole to pole around a fresh peach (circumnavigating the Equator is for know-nothings), giving it a quick quarter-turn, removing the pit and squeezing the juice right into your mouth. Peachy! Finish was equally peachy.   Bottom line: If you like peaches (and I do), you will really dig this. If you are filling the cooler, this should go in last, right on top. You could show up at the beach lonely, crack one of these and you would be swarmed by honeys. I mean, honey bees. CAN't be sexist in this day and age.\"}\n",

Flavors give just about everything detected in the nose, but with a more lactic base balanced by the subtle flavor of burnt grains. I don't know what it is, and maybe that's why I won't expound on the flavor any further, but words escape me, other than the usual hyperbole of 'amazing\", \"awesome\", \"fantastic\", \"terrific', et al.   Although it sports a healthy carbonation, there's something creamy, sweet and lactic here, coating the mouth with a gentle smoothness. The finish provides lasting stickiness full of roasted nuts, chocolate and frothed milk.  The 8.3% is extremely well-incorporated. (That's the ABV given on this bottle.) I won't say well-hidden, because it's there as a warming undercurrent. Overall an insanely delicious offering.

Although it might appear black at first glance any movement will unhinge stripe after stripe of sangria red accenting. Its opacity proves too weak against the light. There is no head but in its place instead is a thin string that entwines the outside.  Sometimes the aromas in a beer can be so elaborate that the multitude of scents all become a harmony of finely interwoven notes that knot together to create an ambrosia so intricate, so splendid that it renders the use of words futile. And other times it's simple, like in this instance. Roast malts, coffee, bakers chocolate - simple, wholesome, sumptuous.  And those three words are fit to describe the flavour, too. The trio of roasted malts, coffee and chocolate carry over into the flavour where, after so much sniffing, it is most gratifying to finally get a taste of them. There is a tinge of smoke, a drop of dark caramel and maybe a pinch of dark fruit, but that's about where the nuances end.   This porter could pass for your morning coffee (if you take it black) or it might go just as well with a late night dessert. It is substantially malty, enough so that it seems strangely nourishing, even strengthening. It's well carbonated and amply bittersweet. It is hearty and a well-suited companion for cold, dreary, rainy weather.  Sierra Nevada labels boasts claims of 'purest ingredients' and 'finest quality'. You can rest assured those are not deceptive statements. In fact, they could add a few more - 'balanced and flavorful\", \"endlessly quaffable\", \"beer as it's meant to be' - and still not even begin to touch on the reasons for their success over the last few decades.\"}\n",

The aroma is an interesting mixture of butter caramel and roasted malt. It isn't very often that a stout delivers this much diacetyl. I'm okay with it as long as it doesn't dominate the flavor profile.  Sorry Schmohz fans, Bonecrusher Stout (in the bottle at least) is not a very good English stout. One more thing... the brewery uses words like 'robustly presented\", \"aggressive' and 'huge' on the label and the website. That's BS because BS is none of those things. Besides, the ABV is only 6.4%, so how big could it be?  A major malt shortage starts things off on the wrong foot and ultimately keeps the beer from being successful. A minor sweetness and a minor bitterness are superceded by a significant lemon juice tartness that has no place in a stout, not even a milk stout.  Flavors include Nestle Quik mixed with mineral water, weak caramel notes, watery butter and lemon juice. Even though it tastes like it, this can't be old beer because SBC has just started bottling in the past several months. I hope the brewers get the kinks worked out because this is seriously kinky beer that isn't easy to drink.  Simply put, the mouthfeel is atrocious. This brew feels like a poor-quality Euro dark lager whose bubbles decided they had better things than to do and skedaddled after the first few mouthfuls. Thin and borderline lifeless is not a recipe for success.  Speaking of which, I wish this small Grand Rapids brewery all the success in the world, but they'll have to earn it. Bonecrusher Stout is not getting them off to a rousing start. Maybe Hopknocker Imperial IPA will be better. It could hardly be worse.\"}\n",

Poured from a 500ml flip-top bottle into a Stein.  A: The body presents an inviting clear chestnut with a bone-meal hearty 3cm that dissipates to a thin lacing.  S: Similar to the others - bold malt grain base with sour yeast throughout and a light fresh spicy/peppery hop note on the finish. Overall it's a winner and I'm expecting a clean dry lager with some minimal hop bitterness. Note: This one has a hint of smoke.  T: Large malt grains upfront, not as sweet as the other Marzen's, followed by sour yeast and crisp, slightly peppery hops to finish. This brew is much lighter (in body and taste) than expected and the aftertaste has a weird tang that is a combination of typical hop bitterness and sour yeast, it's not a deal breaker but it's likewise not needed.  M: As mentioned above - lighter than other Marzen's. I would rank it as low(ish) with an almost flat carbonation.  D: Not bad but not great - just below the Spaten in my books and not even close to the Lowenbrau, that aftertang dropped a few points in the flavour department (which as we all know is the best department). I like the colour; IPA country there. This brew is like the Janus of beers - on the one face we've got this excellent looking, inviting aroma Marzen, and on the other we've got this lackadaisical mouthfeel and odd aftertaste... almost like the name of the brewer 'Hacker, cool!\", \"Pschorr, WTF?', just drop the 'Pschorr' Hacker and then we're taking business.  Food match: You'll want something that coats the palate while drinking this brew, like an assortment of dips (Hommus and Baba ghanoush are always winners) and bread.

Wow, curious flavors in an IIPA, but ones I really enjoy. Some leafy bittering in the finish; a good beer that, for once, leans a bit more heavily on malt than hops.

I have no problem at all appreciating either the orange peel or the coriander and wouldn't change the relative amounts of either one. In fact, this would be a good demonstration beer to show newbies what coriander smells like. And what a fantastic witbier smells like in the bargain.  No letdown on the palate, not one little bit (except, perhaps, when it comes to the body). Like the nose, the flavor contains all of the standard witbier elements, easily identified and combined in near perfect proportions. I'd like even more bud bursting flavor, but then that's always the case, no matter the style.  There's a faint hint of flame-kissed wheat malt that lays down a stable bottom end and allows the citrus peel and spice to do their things. In addition to orange, I think that I can taste lemon as well, though I doubt that any actual lemon peel was added to the brew kettle. Sweet, tangy and bitter co-exist in perfect harmony with the lack of any one of those contributing to a sky high sessionability.  I'm well aware that beer of this style does not and should not have a big body. Still though, this one could stand to be a tad more full and expansive. It fades away too quickly and too completely on the finish and just does manage to avoid being painted with the 'watery' brush. The low level of carbonation could use a small nudge upwards as well.  If anyone thinks that the 'Hummer' of the name refers to a large motor vehicle, perhaps the label will provide them with a few clues as to the true reference. 'An arousing white ale!\", \"Stimulating hints of... ', etc. Sweetwater Summer Hummer is a very good witbier and is a summer quencher that would be a staple if I lived in the South.

Maduro (meaning 'ripe\", \"mature') looks terribly overripe to me - all beers result from fermentation but by the time they're bottled most don't actually look like they're still in the process of it! This muddy brown body would have benefited from a little filtration; only against the light does it not look like sludge.   Where as most English brown ales smell noticeably of water minerals and most American brown ales smell appreciably of hops, this Floridian example of the style has an odd sulfuric tint to it, a seemingly unintentional by-product of the brewing process that distracts from the otherwise pleasant coffee-ish and toffee-like malts and dark fruity esters.   Oatmeal sure thickened things up, which I'm not so sure benefits the style: this is a very unsubtle beer, tasting strongly of grains and oatmeal without much of any of the finer nuances you typically find in the style (toast, toffee, nuttiness, caramel or biscuits). Even the hops are menial. While it tastes stronger, it lacks in the style's usual chemistry.   A lightly sweet but very prevalent note of dark fruit is present, something like prune or raisin. It overtakes the slight chocolatey or coffee-like flavours and seems to accentuate the otherwise modest note of alcohol. A lightly sooty, coffee-like roast gains its footing on the finish, however, but its slightly astringent character lessens the enthusiasm for another sip.   Like the only other Cigar City beer I've had at this point, Maduro tastes somewhat 'unfinished', more like a batch of homebrew than commercial beer. I'm willing to chalk it up yet again to an off-bottle, but until this brewery can capitalize on their popularity enough to expand distribution - or until I find another trading partner as generous Ultraman9000 - I can't be sure that this brewery's beers aren't just better in ratings than they are in reality.\"}\n",

I know you're supposed to rate a beer in line with its style, but since this is the first 'imperial pumpkin ale' I've had, I have no precedent for it. I predict this review will be my biggest deviation from the average score of a beer, but I'm being completely honest with it.  (Drank out of Duvel Tulip)  Appearance: Surprisingly light and pale. I expected more of a rich, copper colour. A very thin head completely dissipated within minutes  Smell: Absolutely nauseating. Like being trapped in a compact car with 100 Vanilla air fresheners and 50 'Autumn baking scents' air fresheners (Not high quality air fresheners you'd buy at a quaint boutique, I'm talking air fresheners manufactured in a Bangladeshi sweatshop). No pumpkin whatsoever. There is nothing....literally NOTHING natural about this aroma.  Taste: It's almost like there is a hint of pumpkin trying to express itself here, but it's being completely overpowered by the permeating stench described above, almost like a timid, meek guy trying to have his voice heard at a Jersey Shore-esque house party. Two seconds post-swallow there are some noticeable hops, which offer a welcome but brief reprieve from the olfactory assault.  Mouthfeel: Thin and light. The fact that it isn't thicker makes the beer seem that much more artificial.  Drinkability: I'm a cheap bastard and will never drain pour a beer. Sometimes I will use a bad beer for cooking, but for the life of me I cannot think of a dish that this vile beer would lend itself to. It took me 4 hours to finish this. I wanted to share it with my girlfriend, who was a big fan of Creme Brulee and Choklat, but after one sip she gagged and pushed the bottle back to me.

I was thinking, at first, that this one was going to lean more to the direction of being an extremely hoppy specialty ale like hazed an infused, but after a few sips, I am convinced that it is definitely an IPA, and to be completely honest, it is probably my favorite of the style that I have sampled thus fur, which is saying a lot because I have tried many an IPA.

The aroma is more heavily toasted than roasted, is moderately earthy, and is only mildly hoppy. Underwhelming so far.  First of all, it's tough to work around all the fizziness.

The taste is thin and sweet, but not very dry. There's a slight hoppy bitterness in the finish, and just a touch of typical pilsner hops in the aftertaste. Overall, this is a very plain, uninspired effort.\"}\n",

This was the beer of the weekend for me, and beer of the year so far.   The pour is jet black, still with no head. Reddish brown highlights are noted, but for the most part, this is just black as pitch.  The nose is unreal. Bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, caramel and dark fruit oxidation, this is just beautifully balanced. A very faint soy character is present, but for the most part, this is chocolate syrup, dark chocolate, raisins and some prunes. Beautiful stuff.  The palate is (surprise!) unreal. Big bourbon and vanilla up front, but what sets this beer apart from other -bal aged imperial stouts is the oxidation and how beautifully it married with the base beer with a ~50-60% cocoa dark chcolate, mild bitterness from roasted malt and just the touch of coffee. This is like chocolate syrup with bourbon in it minus all the cloying character that a syrup would have. Bourbon on the finish with caramel and vanilla, this is just exceptional. Oxidation is moderate with mild raisin and prune character, this beer is full in body with low/no carbonation. The lack of carbonation could be perceived as a flaw, but believe you me, it works with this beer, forcing the mellow chocolate, bourbon and vanilla to linger on your palate without being bothered. This is just exceptional, I could drink it all day.  Looking back at my review, I see that I've bandied 'exceptional\", \"beautiful' and 'balanced' about to the point where their meaning is probably lost, but I can't help it, I am quite in shock by how good this beer is and can't help but gush. To me, this beer does to imperial stouts what Beatification 001-PH1 did to wild ales and what M did to barleywines - show what the style could achieve, show what balance,subtlety and complexity are all about. Thank you again, Trey, I am forever indebted to you for this. I hope the person generous enough to trade this to you got to try it elsewhere.\"}\n",

The brewery brags about this beer having 'full flavour\", \"lots of flavour' and a 'rich malt body'. They don't do the same bragging about its aroma and the reason why is plainly obvious: there really isn't much of one. With enough swirling and some stretch of the imagination I can detect a very mild floral type component, very honeysuckle like.   I'd say those claims about the flavour are wholly exaggerated as well. As it smells, this tastes quite mild. There's a touch of bread, some grassy herbs, sweet and toasty cereal grain and again, perhaps, a honeysuckle like floral note. But hey, if you want a ton of flavour don't go looking for it in a 3.9% lager! (Look for it in this brewery's 3.5% mild ale!)   I wouldn't say that it's the 'lots of flavour and body that separates it from the rest.' What separates this from other lagers is that it's well crafted. You're darn tootin' this is 'an easy drinking lager with a difference'. This is a throw to a time before adjuncts and chemicals. The beer is clean and tastes like down-to-earth, good old fashion tried and true beer.   As with the other Grand River beers I've had, warming seems to do only good. Much more hop and malt flavour comes out. I think that's further testament not only to the quality of the ingredients but the skill of the brewmaster as well. Brewing beers this light and low in alcohol does not allow much room for error. This lager may be plain but it's well made.   I've tried most of the Grand River lineup now and can honestly say I'd love to have any of them on-tap in the house. (And I'm fortunate enough to usually find them on-tap when I'm out of the house.) Town Hall Lager wouldn't come from me as highly recommended as the other offerings, but if you enjoy one Grand River beer you'd probably enjoy them all.\"}\n",

The flavor makes up for the lack-luster presentation. A nice ale bitter start comingled with malt but not a lot of other flavor hints. As I recall the barrel aged version of this beer had a 'fatter\", \"rounder' flavor with somewhat more complexity.   Finish is long lasting clean dissolution of the bitter start signature.

Orange peel and spicy coriander are definitely present in the nose, it's just that they don't add up to anything out of the ordinary. Actually, the aroma is better than ordinary, but it isn't better than slightly better than ordinary.   I like what Flying Dog has done with Woody Creek White. The balance among the three main flavors (wheat, orange peel and coriander) is spot-on and the heft is just about perfect for a quenching summer seasonal. How can anyone drink pale wheat ales when witbiers and hefeweizens are so much more delicious?  The grain bill consists of Belgian pilsner malt, white wheat (malted, unmalted and flaked), and flaked oats. Good choices, all. The underlying flavor is of fresh cereal grains with a minimum of huskiness. The fruit and spice, while it could be more prominent, adds color and shading to those solid outlines. Sweet, bitter and tangy are roughly equivalent, until the increasingly bitter finish puts an exclamation point on the mouthful.  I like the overall size of the beer, but the mouthfeel could be more creamy. The bubbles tend to sit and sizzle on the tongue (just a little) rather than providing the expansiveness that almost all quality beer possesses.  I thought I had an outside chance to win the 'name our summer seasonal' contest that Flying Dog ran this past year. Thinking they'd want to continue the dog theme, I suggested names such as 'Tail Wagger\", \"Leash Ripper' and 'White Hydrant', among others. I like Woody Creek White though.

I'm not sure why I mentioned hops when describing the aroma because I certainly don't taste any. I'll say one thing, D Light has more flavor than most light beers. Too bad that flavor sucks.  Yeah, this is a kolsch, but it's also a 'light ale'. The calorie and carb counts are 128 and 9.2 respectively. For comparison's sake, Sam Adams Light weighs in at 124 and 9.7.

It's a close call, but the next highest score isn't warranted.  My expectations were pretty high for a Swedish-brewed, American-style IPA that uses Amarillo hops. That's why the nose is doubly disappointing. Exhibit 'A\", \"B' and 'C' is that there's almost no hoppiness, which is inexcusable in a beer of this style. A few more degrees of warming pulls the aroma, kicking and screaming, up to average.  The fact that this is the new purple and gold-labeled India Pale Ale would suggest that it's somewhat fresh. It doesn't taste old, it just doesn't taste very hoppy. The malt backbone is barely sturdy enough. It tastes like mostly pale with a hint of something slightly toasted. The relative lack of hops means that the 5.3% ABV, which is already low for the style, is appreciated on the taste buds. Not much, but too much.  Nils Oscar brags about how many hops they use (don't they all?). Unfortunately, it isn't borne out by the beer itself. Bitterness, which is nowhere near abusive, outpaces good hop flavor by a country mile. Hey Nils, how about doubling the hop load? And how about adding them later in the boil, as long as I'm throwing out suggestions. The flavor profile consists of orange rind and crushed aspirin soaked in sugar syrup and a small splash of Absolut Citron.  The mouthfeel is lighter than it should be... but take a look at the ABV again. It eventually wins me over, more or less, by having a perfect amount of carbonation (subdued) and by being as smooth as glass.  IPAs are one of my favorite styles and Oktoberfests aren't. I find it strange, then, that Nils Oscar Kalasol was enjoyable and Nils Oscar India Pale Ale isn't.

I've never crushed fresh Hallertau hops in my hands and then inhaled the residue, but it must smell something like Imperial Pilsner. Actually, that isn't strictly true. The beer also has a sweet pale maltiness that gives depth and breath to the hop resins. I hadn't noticed it before, but this hop's muskiness reminds me, in some respects, of Cascade.  I like this beer just as much as the beer that inspired it, Samuel Adams Imperial Pilsner 2005 Harvest. Maybe more. Pay very close attention to the label if you're ambivalent about hops because phrases such as 'Intense Hop Experience\", \"enormous, almost reckless quantities... of hops' is truth in advertising. This stuff will rip the top several layers off your mouth and tongue without breaking a sweat.  The thing that makes this insanely delicious beer, though, is that it isn't *only* about the hops. Somewhere, way down deep, lives a sugar cookie-like pale maltiness that just does manage to take the intensely serrated edges off the alpha acids. Aging this ale should be a crime punishable by death. As fresh as possible is the only way to go.  I never knew that Hallertau Mittelfrueh were this fruity. I'm getting tons of peach and apricot, along with tidal waves of sticky orange marmalade and shards of bitter lemon. Each mouthful is an explosion of hop flavor that lasts and lasts and lasts. I better slow down or there won't be anything left to assess the mouthfeel.  While it doesn't quite deserve a perfect score, this elixir is pure pleasure in the mouth. It's at least medium-full and is as plush as one could ever hope for. It seems that the brewers have struck the perfect balance between luxuriousness and ease of drinkability.  I have no idea if Samuel Adams Hallertau Imperial Pilsner is identical to Imperial Pilsner 2005 Harvest. My guess is that it's pretty damn close and my suspicion is that it's even hoppier.

Transparent light gold with a moderate amount of big-bubbled carbonation. The head is dirty white, soft, and insubstantial. In other words, it looks cheap. To add insult to injury, it falls to a thin film in minutes and leaves almost no lace. The nose is of slightly sour grain, cooked veggies and a hint of (admittedly decent) lemon peel. Like attempting to smell good by dousing oneself in cologne rather than bathing?  Lone Star is yet another substandard adjunct lager. Or is that a redundancy? A serious shortage of malt leads to a thin, watery mouthfeel and a harsh, metallic flavor that's all kinds of unpleasant, but stops just short of spit-it-out bad.

One gulp is all it took to tell me that not only is Overland Vice a hefe weizen, but a kick-ass hefe weizen at that. Sugared banana esters practically exploded over my mouth and tongue, leading to one of the highest banan-o-meter scores that I've ever granted: 4.5/5.0. Ground clove was present, but was relegated to being a backseat driver.  The flavor was a near perfect mix of ripe banana puree, warm clove, biscuity pale malt, lush wheat malt and alcohol. Far from being a deal breaker, the background alcohol made the beer taste midway between a standard hefe and a double hefe. I'd guess the ABV to be bumping up against the state minimum. At least.  This is one of those cases where my ideal flavor score is midway between two numbers. I've decided to chose the lower one and use the drinkability score to massage the total upward. Not that the drinkability score isn't deserved on its own.  The mouthfeel was medium for the style and finished with more than a trace of mouthcoating stickiness. I liked the way it allowed the flavor to linger until the next sip. The gentle feel of the carbonation was right up my alley and was another reason why the drinkability score was well-earned.

Sticky webs of lacing lend to this, while beneath rests a peacefully clear beer, lightly honeyed in color. Approachable and sessionable are a few words entering into my brain.  This beer's nose is a well blended bag of maple, shortbread, grapefruit and wild grasses. Nothing seems to stand out more than the other, and that's a good thing. Balance in the nose adds some complexity, if not raw hop power. Later I go back for a sip and start to pick up some warming, deeply floral hop that spreads in my nose and makes me tingle. There it is.  This IPA moves lightly in the mouth. The carbonation keeps the liquid from coating, while a bit of raw hop oils and malt body provide an anchor for tastes to both seep and shine. Starts with a sweetly prickly tangerine hoppiness... just shining here. It spreads and deepens, exposing cannabis characteristics that get the tongue bracing. What a transition. Beyond that there's just enough round malt backing to provide a platform for hops to dance and jump, and even to make a quick caramel impact and the height of the tongue. Hops are tropical again in the finish, leaving a bright (mango), but ultimately bitter finish. This transition between bright tropical fruits and deeper, earthy bitterness is outstanding. The top of the mouth is temporarily numbed with hops, but recover quickly and are ready for more. Just dry enough (muted in some ways), to keep the anticipation high for the next sip.   If this beer was my local, I'd have a hard time restraining myself. Very drinkable for the 6.6% abv and the 75IBU. I don't know how Portlanders do it.\"}\n",

This certainly tastes like the monks must have a secret concoction of far-away spices but they don't. The only trick up their sleeve is the magic of yeast!  Ginger glazed squash, plum pudding, coriander spiced pink fish, sticky toffee pudding, vintage Italian reds, cinnamon torts, Madeira port, peanut brittle, lavender tea... the list can go on and on and on.

Lucent, pale yellow-gold; no surprises there. This one looks a quarter-shade darker than the Busch, but it still fits comfortably in the pale category. The head is dingy, grayish white and is less appealing for that reason alone. The consistency is mealy and soft and the cap falls shockingly quickly to a thin film that is dissipating as I type.  The noses are virtually identical. Of course, a lack of much of an aroma at all makes it hard to sort out what slight differences might exist. 'Not offensive' is the best that I can do as far as good points. Coors Light smells like slightly sweet grain with a not unpleasant, mildly floral hoppiness.  Neither one of these is good beer by any stretch of the imagination. The flavor is of old grain; musty and slightly sour. This is a beer that will probably become frankly undrinkable if I let it warm much further. A minimal sweetness and a near total lack of bitterness greet my every sip. What's left? Old, watery, grain soup. Yuck.  There isn't much to say on the body/mouthfeel front. Both are watery in the extreme and have thankfully short finishes. This beer is marginally less carbonated, both visually and mouthfeel-wise, and feels a little less accomplished as a result.  I have rarely been more ready for a MacSmack to end than I am today. These are two of the worst beers that I've ever had the displeasure to consume. Still though, there are degrees of badness, as the Macro Smackdown series never fails to demonstrate. Coors Light is lousy, plain and simple.

Very slightly hazed, orange-accented amber. Fine, lazy carbonation rises to the medium-sized, cream colored head. The cap of foam appears dense and sticky, falls over time to a thick film and leaves broken sheets of lace. The nose was nice on my pint at the brewpub, but it's even more impressive now that there are no sensory distractions. A wonderously fruity hoppiness is bursting from the glass with very little else to clutter things up. Just as it should be. One of the best noses on any pale ale that I've ever had. In fact, it rivals many of the great IPAs.  It's as good as I remember (perhaps even better) with loads of citrusy hoppy goodness front and center. Just as in the nose, there's very little else--malt for instance--to get in the way of this liquid paean to the Columbus hop. The beer tastes amazingly like sweetened grapefruit, lemon and orange zest. The bittering is near perfect, lending just enough bite to the pungeant, citrus fruity flavor.   The mouthfeel is absolutely perfect for a pale ale: medium-full, lightly creamy and exquisitely silky. Words that spring to mind are 'clean\", \"pure' and 'bright'. In fact, when steorn and I were talking beer at the brewpub, he mentioned, after taking a sip of this very beer, that it seemed exceptionally clean. The tasting notes in my pocket at that very moment contained the word 'clean' in capital letters.  I feel that I need to take a moment here to apologize to the Columbus hop. I have previously denigrated it, largely as a result of my experience with another Columbus-exclusive beer, Anderson Valley's Hop Ottin'. I now admit that I couldn't have been more wrong. The Columbus, which is displayed with such brilliance in this beer, can stand toe-to-toe with some of my very favorites such as Cascade, Centennial and Amarillo.  The brewer at Town Hall has fashioned a masterful single-hopped pale ale that puts the strengths of its hop on display for all to see (er...taste). As I said above, this is a liquid paean to the Columbus hop and is a pale ale that has rocketed to the top of my list of all-time greats for that style.   As the saying goes, 'all great things must come to an end'. Perhaps, in the end, that makes them all the more desirable. This is the bottom line: if this beer makes a return visit to Town Hall, so will I. Immediately.\"}\n",

It isn't anywhere near as smoky as most of the Brauerei Heller-Trum (Aecht Schlenkerla) lineup, but it's no lightweight either. There's something else in the nose that keeps me from loving it. Maybe my taste buds will figure it out.  Z Lager is actually a pretty authentic rauchbier as I understand the style. I have no idea if it was brewed in the traditional way, but it tastes like it to me. I'm happy to see that the brewery didn't back off on the smoked malt as much as they claim to have. Maybe they don't want to scare off any prospective buyers who might be a little uneasy about a smoke-flavored beer.  It tastes and (especially) feels as though there's more than enough malt onboard. Enough, at least, to provide a touch of needed sweetness to act as a foil to the smoke. The flavor profile has a rounded, mellow character that keeps it from being a smoky one trick pony. This really is a well done smoked lager from where I sit.  The mouthfeel has an impressive amount of lush expansiveness for a sub-5.0% lager. This offering wouldn't have worked nearly as well if it had been thin and overly bubbled. Kudos to Fort Collins Brewery for giving each of the beer's attributes equal attention.  Z Lager is one of the best beers from this brewery that I've had yet. There aren't too many American craft brewers who will even attempt a rauchbier. I suspect that there considerably fewer who could brew one this competently. This stuff would be a perfect match for a pulled pork sandwich, baked beans and cole slaw. Is it lunchtime yet?\"}\n",

A good sized head that fades back pretty quickly. A little head stays around in blotchy clumps.  Smells of heavy malt, dried fruit. I think the operative term here is heavy. Enticing.  Taste is of dark red plums, dates, figs... Soft and fry fruit that doesn't have too much bite. (one exception is a nice blackberry touch). Lingering light acid notes. Certainly worth the time to savour (and I don't know how you couldn't savour, given the strength of the beer).  Mouthfeel is typical to a bottle-conditioned Belgian. When it's cold the little bubbles swarm on the tongue and give a really envigorating feel. As it warms up the carbonation is smoother and softer. The body of the liquid is relatively thick.  The Chimay Grande Reserve (blue label) has long been the accepted standard of this style. This destroys Chimay.

The beer itself is a hazy orange golden color. On the nose, I have yeast, malts, some floral aromas as well as a light dash of apricot.

It was somewhat similar to some blonds but very well done in this one albeit the fact that I am not to comfy with too much yeast jumping at me. Slightly citrusy in the taste but not much fruits detected which was a pity (think there was also a dash of apricot here). Some clear bready earthy tones too. The taste was generally strong and fairly complex, although I am not a big fan of yeasty tastes, I have to take my hat of this one. The finish was also yeasty but it unveiled a most wonderful after taste thereafter. I had apricots and then clearly apples with some very sublte malt sweetness. After the apples came delicious grapes lasting though a bit and 'strong\", \"tasty' and 'lingering' would be how I describe the after taste! The Fin Du Monde is between medium to full body thickness and the carbonation was good and active. Alcohol warming and strength were clear but the smoothness was not taken away; it goes down a little dry. This is a nice beer and I am glad I tried it though I am not a big fan of blonds. This one is clearly a great blond style for whoever is into the style; it tastes more like a blond than a tripel but that's one hell of a great blond we are talking about.

The edges are smoky orange in color, further evidence that there's a lot of *something* present. Here's hoping that something is hop flecks. Given the language on the silk-screened label ('super hoppy\", \"in celebration of the hop\", \"a hop tribute'), I'd say hops are a good bet. The head is pale caramel in color and is firmly creamy. A thick blanket of lace has already shown up, leading me to expect a glass coater.  Super hoppy is right! The nose screams HOPS with full-throated gusto. This American DIPA is absolutely bursting with sweet, juicy fruit: orange, grapefruit, pineapple and passionfruit at least. If the hop bill wasn't printed on the bottle (Tomahawk, Cascade and Centennial), I would have bet the farm that Amarillo was in there somewhere. Pine sap is a welcome contributor as well.  Hopsickle has too much caramel malt for my tastes. The sweet caramel candy stickiness blunts the bright hoppiness to a significant extent. This Moylan's offering falls decidedly into the balanced DIPA camp (that is much closer to an American barleywine), not the souped-up, IPA-like DIPA camp. That makes it sweeter than most, with a brown sugar syrup quality that I'm enjoying.  As noted, the hop flavor has been rendered earthbound by gooey liquid caramel. Grapefruit peel is the dominant hop flavor, with the more tropical fruit qualities of the nose falling by the wayside. Bitterness is still substantial however. This is a major tongue ruffler, a quality that sneaks up on the drinker due to the smoothing, soothing character of all those malt sugars.  The mouthfeel is as expected. That is, full, heavy, syrupy, sticky, honeyish, etc. Since the ingredient that keeps me from loving the flavor profile is the same one responsible for the gargantuan body, I can't very well give it a perfect score, can I? I'd gladly trade a little mouthfeel for a more hop-dominant beer.  Hopsickle is a great name for a DIPA, but Hopsickle isn't a great DIPA. My preference should be obvious by now. Simply put, malt doesn't deserve to share the stage with hops in beer of this style. I still feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to try this one. Thanks lou91.\"}\n",

I have to admit, this was a beer I was skeptical about tasting/reviewing. After seeing so many negative (D & F) scores for this GLBC offering, I was put off. GLBC is one of my favorite craft brewing companies. Everything I've had from them has been solid and very much to BJCP style guidelines. So when I started reading things like 'sulphuric\", \"farty' and 'skunky', I was thinking, 'OMG, has GLBC finally gone and produced a loser?' 'Did a bad batch get out?' Fortunately, by attending the fest, I was able to dispell all those notions. Now to the review.  The pour from tap produces a nice apricot yellow colored brew, capped with a light and fluffy off-white head. Head retention is decent, with evidence of some lacing (not a lot though).  The nose is lightly scented with various herbs and is very much like your typical Saison. This one has a few other notes to ponder, beyond the citric, zesty lemon aromas you typically get. There is coriander and lemon basil. I get the coriander, but I'm not sure I can put my finger on the basil.  Taste, again, is very typical of a Saison, but has more of a spicy note than a citric lemony note. I guess this is GLBC's own signature on the style. Its not objectionable, just different. NOTE: I found absolutely *nothing* in the nose or taste that even remotely brought 'sulphuric, 'farty' or 'skunky' to mind, so forget about that right now. Those who used those adjectives perhaps might not have had Saisons before, or have an 'under developed palate'. Mouthfeel is closer to medium than light, and very smooth. Despite a moderate abv of 6.2%, there is no notice of the alcohol - no fusel notes at all. I'd rate drinkability as high; for those who appreciate the Saison style. There is *no* Farmhouse Funk associated with this brew .. relax and let the melody of flavors commingle on your palate.  Not my favorite GLBC brew by a long shot, but I did enjoy it, after finally having a chance to taste and review it. Don't let the negative reviews scare you off, as they did me. If you enjoy Saisons, seek this one out and give it a try.  Na Zdravje!\"}\n",

First tastes seemed a bit skewed toward sweetness and grain, but given time and a couple more sips the balancing hop backbone rounds things out.  M: Velvety smoothness with a light carbonated prickle. Mellow boozy warmth creeps up steadily and stealthily. Lingering dull bitterness on the back of the tongue, lip-smacking stickiness without being cloying.  D: All too easy to consume, ended too quickly. Would gladly have more - the ground spices are balanced well by those hops; end result: a tasty warmer that blends seasonal flavor and introduces a hard-to-describe 'nostalgia'.

This smattering of such non-descript statements lets me know that I'm in for one of the beers of all time.  Poured to a pint glass, three fingers of white head surface for a cameo before settling down. Retention is actually pretty good and the lacing is nice. The beer is a pale bronze tint that looks soft but implies that it is watered down. Carbonation is very active. It is suspiciously reminiscent of Genesee Cream Ale.  The aroma gives off a little hop presence. It's barely noticeable, but I was surprised to recognize it at all given the low price this carries. The rest of the scent is prototypical corn-adjunct lager. It smells a bit more watery than average but still quite sweet.  The taste is a pleasant surprise; not in the sense that it's a revelation for the style, but in the sense that a $.50 can of beer shouldn't be this good. It's treading in the 'lite' end of the American lager pool, but with a slight edge in the depth of flavor. The malt bill tastes sweet and grainy. Corn is used in a way that compliments the brew. Aftertaste is non-existent. It's a bit watery, which is why it feels more like light beer; but it is backed by enough taste to get a thumbs up.  In the mouth Big Flats barely registers above water. This can be a positive thing as I can come up with several uses for this beer. It's the classic yard-chore refreshment, a barbeque beer, what beer drinkers drink when they're not drinking beer, etc. All joking aside though, Big Flats is totally inoffensive and super-drinkable. The supposed 4.5% alcohol goes unnoticed; the brew goes down like water; it's cheap; and best of all, it tastes good for the style.  ---  The Two Schlitz Scale: (see my profile for an explanation) Sure, I give a Schlitz about Big Flats, but definitely not two! Big Flats is cheap and readily available and I'd sincerely recommend it over any of the big three's standard offerings.\"}\n",

The beer seems to express more chocolate malt roastiness as it increases in temp slightly. The feel is pretty sweet up front, very mild roast in the middle and slight bitterness peaks as it starts to finish with more sweet malt balancing in the last sips.   The taste is a mix of roasted malt and sweet caramel that seems to dominate the former. The flavor of roasted barley and chocolate malt as you might expect but the flavor doesn't really develop further -the yeast is clean and the beer doesn't have any off flavors really, just lacks any true stand-out flavors. The hops add to the bitterness which balances the primary malt flavor -caramel, but doesn't add much to the taste and the roasted taste is a simple coffee-like add-on which could use something to bring it together. The alcohol is not very high for the style again, lacking offensive flavors, but it just misses. Overall I found this to be an 'ok\", \"safe' beer. I was really hoping the first taste of mudhook would prove a little more inspiring, basically your standard 'by the numbers' stout.

On first impression, this has all the components of a very weak traditional amber ale. The malt focus is well beyond the hops with a light breadiness from the yeast. On the nose, I smell some light/medium caramel malts and a touch of adjunct -- a bunch of honey in the background. The finish, however, is inordinately crisp (mellower as it warms). A very mild hop bittering reminds me of pilsener beer as does the prickly carbonation.   Lo and behold, the BJCP specs for a 'cream ale\": \"Low hop bittering. Low maltiness; however, grainy sweetness from corn may be present. . . . Adaptation of American light lager. Fermented like an ale, followed by cold condition or a blending of ale and lager beers' (BJCP Style Guide, http://bjcp.org/styleguide03.html).  Besides its miserable head retention, Spotted Cow is precisely what a cream ale ought to be.   The malty nose marries very well with a lightly adjuncted honey sweetness -- like a microbrewed PBR.

From what I know of it, I'm guessing they used it with restraignt, as it isn't overpowering. Works well with the oakyness.  Tastes almost like a light round semi-sweet, apple cider mixed with bourbon.   Hops are non-existent to my palate. This beer is all about bourbon maltiness and fruit.   The bock just drips (watered down) sour mash whiskey. As a bourbon drinker, it's interesting...but really just makes me wish I was drink bourbon... To me it feels thin, not because it's light or watery (for a beer), but b/c the flavor profile is one that I associate with the heaviness & acoholic bite of whiskey. In the end, they have created something interesting, if not functional (you could get a similar effect from mixing bourbon, sour apple juice and club soda). It is exactly what they intended it to be; a limited edition, 'unplugged\", \"hey, look what we can do' beer.\"}\n",

This is a rich, full to medium-bodied brew with a smooth, creamy, light mouthfeel. Roasted notes are in the forefront and pair with a lemony/limey-rind-like hop presence that takes the entire taste to a near astrigent level. You can pick up some floral-like flavours from the hops too. Malt flavours of coffee, plump raisins, prune/plum, bitter chocolate and faint smoke beckon to balance a foundation of bitterness, both roasted malt and hops. Nice rounded background sweetness. The finish on this stout contains notes of smoke and a roasted/sweet feel on the palate.  Notes: I've had quite a few Imperial Stouts in my day, each attempting to dethrown the other. In my opinion, Samuel Smith's might not be the most powerful in alcohol, or as assertive as others, but it is the king. All yield and recognize the truth.

Ok, popping the top here, I found the STRANGEST thing I've ever found in one of my beers. For about an inch and a half all around the top of the bottle from the lip (and inside of the cap) is a dark, muddy pink/brown paste. It almost looks like melted wax of the lesser-quality variety (i.e. what's used on New Glarus' fruit beers. Weirdest freaking thing I've ever seen. If this were just 'any' beer, I'd probably dump it out, but now that I have this, I'm all systems go...  Appearance: Hazy, ruddy orange/brown beer with pink highlights. Nice, creamy ivory cap with pink hints. Amazing sheets of lace. Really quite attractive overall.   Smell: It's JP, so of course there's tons of Bretty goodness front and center. Vibrantly fruity, earthy, and funky. Just a hint of strawberry as well. I'm not getting a anything specifically rose-like here, but it is a bit flowery.   Taste: Wild, and slightly tart, but not over-the-top; this is nicely nuanced and balanced. Although I'm having trouble pulling out any individual fruit flavors here (I get a bit of raspberry after awhile), but this is absolutely bursting with fruity and floral flavors of the Brett variety. Nothing that specifically shouts 'rose', but this is really pleasant. Just a hint of crisp, dry pale/pils malt on the finish. Tart, but delicately so, like raspberries and slightly underripe fruit. Lightly bitter on the finish.   Mouthfeel: Light side of medium-bodied.   Overall: When I started in on this, I was thinking I was gonna be a bit disappointed in that this was going to be 'just another' wild beer. And, while it's true that I don't get anything specific here that shouts 'rose\", \"rose hips', or 'hibiscus', it really is a beautifully fruity, floral, brettanomyces-kissed brew that (unlike many American Wild Ales, and some from JP for that matter) strikes a perfect balance between yeasty notes, fruity esters, funk, tartness, hop bitterness, and malt.

In a shaker pint glass, E.S. Bam is pale brownish amber with a glint of orange and a storm of fine internal carbonation feeding a huge, pillowy off-white head. As the cap reduces, it consolidates fine, pearly bubbles into large soapy ones at the periphery, leaving the center portion of foam drifted up in rocky, craggy fashion and large 3-D hunks of lacing scattered about the glass.  The smell is sweet and fruity with mild caramel, toffee, plus orange rind oil, a touch of muddy funk, and a whiff of apple cidery, lemony zing. Mild brown malt toastiness underlays the aroma profile, not really taking up a lot of space, but growing in stature as the drink progresses.  The taste is mild and malty with the merest toasty drizzle of sweetened vinegar and a soft mineral steeliness that dries the finish. As I'm looking for descriptors and finding the words 'mild\", \"mere', and 'soft', I realize that no matter how much I want this brew to be more than it is, it just isn't all that flavorful, instead presenting itself almost like a pretty good beer cut with a shot or three of mineral water. The funky-steel flavor and vinegary zing gain purchase in the warming drink, but the notes are left unbalanced by any significant malt backbone, leaving the finish quite dry with a little pucker. Only as the bottom of the bottle close at hand does a note of wheat straw and strawberries sweeten and freshen the drink just a tad.  The drink is light-bodied and underpowered with a fine sizzle of carbonation. The brew is quite drinkable, but only because of its uncanny similarity to the water it's brewed from. A big swing and a miss from a brewer I expect much better beer from.\"}\n",

I grew up with Schlitz being an extremely popular beer in the 50's & 60's and one of my first beers I tasted was Schlitz. Schlitz had some of the best advertizing of the era with great catch phrases like: 'When you're out of Schlitz, your out of beer\", \"You only go around once in life, so grab for all the gusto you can', and of course, 'The beer that made Milwaukee famous, simply because it tasted so good'. Schlitz beer was one of the best macro beers from that era and I believe it still has character even after all these years.  Appearance: Typical clear, straw color, but nice foamy head and sparkling carbonation. Better head than most Macro type offerings.  Smell: Yes, a bit thin. But it is a fresh and clean aroma. No Skunkiness (sp?) here. Corn dominates the nose.  Taste: OK, this is where I still like this beer. Crisp taste, with slight sweetness. Truly, just the kiss of the hops! No aftertaste and very smooth. What can I say but, enjoyable for a Macro beer. Brings back memories of picnics on hot summer days when beer was iced in old galvanized tubs.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, not grainy. No bitterness, but nothing special.  Drinkability: Very good, IMHO. Easy to down one or more and easy to keep a ample supply on hand ($). A regular favorite with the guys on 'card night'. Great with typical 'bar food'. Overall a solid 'case' type beer for any get together, at least with my friends.\"}\n",

A: Coppery auburn pour, perfectly clear, with minimal rising carbonation.

T: Lots of thick, malty caramel and over-ripe fruit. More sweet orange, vinous grapes, dates and raisins. Searching deeper, there are tropical fruit flavors: coconut, mango? Yeastiness feigns a certain spicy/sweet 'Belgian' quality. Noble hops round off the sweetness just enough, imploring this to not go over-the-top 'malty'. An Oktoberfest that, because of it's 'imperialization', comes off akin to a thick doppelbock. Maybe even an eisbock...  M: I debated what score to give here, settling on a 'good' score. Consistency is smooth, minimally carbonated, but syrupy thick. Alcohol level stays 'warm' and sticky sweetness lingers.  D: A tasty big beer, one I'll gladly pour again. Another of those beers that can only exist when brewers push stylistic boundaries, a 9%+ Oktoberfest really wasn't something I rushed to try, but I'm happy I picked this up.

Lucent, deeply burnished orange-bronze with a moderate amount of fine suspended 'stuff'. The pale beige head is smaller than most and is acceptably firm. Scraps of lace are starting to appear, but don't hang around to see how it all ends. The lightly toasted grain-like nose is simply average with no hint of adjuncts.  The flavor is mediocre at best. It's lightly malty with a faint toastedness and is slightly sweet with an underlying mild sourness. 'Lightly\", \"faint\", \"slightly' and 'mild'... you get the picture. There's perhaps a subtle (there I go again) bitterness on the finish without any real hop flavor.   The body is appropriately light-medium and there's not a whole lot of carbonation.

A darkened garnet body capped with three fingers of grainy, brown-sugary foam screams of Belgian-style dark ale, but hardly whispers 'stout'. The head retains for a time, resting at a misshapen wallop and leaving fine webby rings of puffy 3-D lacing stuck upon the sides of the tumbler.  The smell is fruity and chocolatey, with notes of golden raisins, ripe plums and juicy figs amidst a mild but savory dark mocha background.  The taste is fruity with a dark mocha finish; juicy notes of plum and creamy unsweetened chocolate accented with bitter citrus and burnt roast relinquish the finish to notes of cooled strong black coffee. Each renewing sip features a juicy splash of dilute apple-pear-plum that disperses and fades as it works across the palate, dissolving finally into balancing, bittering, dusty burntness.  The brew is light-bodied with plenty of extremely-fine carbonation. Were it not for the 'stout' word on the label, I'd be convinced I just had a nice, mild, quaffable Belgian ale. Did I? Who cares!

The smell is of - a 'pedestrian dark mild' comes to mind, but subsequent deep inhaling reveales some smoky, toffeeish, chocolatey (almost coffeeish) notes. Aroma develops as it progresses, though remains mild.  The (charcoalish) smokiness and bitterish coffee come out more in the taste than in the aroma. Still, it's nothing heavy, and everything remains thin. Rather than 'pedestrian dark mild\", \"pedestrian English porter' first comes to mind. However, like with the aroma, certain subtlies come out, but never to full potential. Honey sweetness intermingles with a roasted bitterness. A bit woody, my guess is that this would be even better on cask. Carbonation is mild. The flavors never blossom, though I sipped this long enough to well-reach room temperature (started off chilled). There are subtle notes that make it reach slightly above-average, IMO, but nothing better. It has something towards a chocolatey coffeeish, woodyish, dryish character in the rather abrupt finish.  The body is thin - almost watery, with mild carbonation - helping drinkability, I suppose, without adding much to texture, or feel overall.  If I were in a pub just grabbing pints to down with my friends I might appreciate this more, for its drinkability (with just enough to it to keep it going). I wish I could concur with the description on the label, but the said characteristics are too subtle for me to truly appreciate, I suppose. With a modest abv, and no 'off' tastes, this is an easy drinker to have at a pub chatting with friends. That's all.\"}\n",

Traces of a husky nuttiness in back, but generally as subtle and unremarkable an aroma as usually found in oatmeal stouts. This is neither a bad nor good thing, it just is what it is.  Flavor delivers deep dark cocoa--polite and rather subtle. Frothed milk sweetness and nutty background gives some depth. Traces of bitter coffee in the finish, and a continued flash of nutty earthiness.   Velvet smoothness and a thinnish body. A calm, subtle texture, mirroring the flavor itself.  A grower, basically.

Poured into Portsmouth snifter. Felt compelled to hear a couple Isaac Hayes (RIP) tunes with this one - what else but the theme from 'Shaft' and 'Chocolate Salty Balls' from Chef Aid: The South Park Album. (late edit: couldn't help but throw in 'No Substitute\", \"Simultaneous,' 'Let's Stay Together,' 'Never Can Say Goodbye' and 'By the Time I Get to Phoenix', but it's about 1 minute 'til 24 so that's the end of the mix for the time being.  Pours a slightly viscous, definitely silky and oily espresso/ebony/jet dark with a few light wisps of milk chocolate and brown sugar head. Head goes rather quickly, leaving a few lighter ginger colored bubbles up top.  I could smell this one's perfume the second she entered the room...ultra sweet chocolate/cocoa essence with a whole lot of grassy hops balancing great copious amounts of smoothly roasted malt, brown sugar sweetness with a touch of molasses and that great back-of-nostril burn of creamy, slightly sweet mellow caramel/toffee booze. The label says dark fruits...maybe a hint of prune on deep background.  This one gets the deep dark roast up front at first blush, but give it some warmth. First impressions are extra-dry patent tannins with a salty (now that's funny) slate...and then we move on to the dry cocoa with grassy and piney hop bitterness. Alcohol at first isn't a player in this one but it gains some strength as the dryness slowly burns off and the creaminess comes into play. The balance comes around in abundance with warmth - getting a little light brown sugar...molasses? Maybe a smidge. This isn't an overly sweet blowout stout; the dryness moves from slate to an aggressive hop character (warrior?). The dark fruits make an entrance - it's definitely prune that's getting together with that brown sugar. By the way, I haven't listened to this Chef album in about 10 years - this is fucking hysterical.  As mentioned, this one starts out dry but gets the motor running with only minor prodding. Slight levels of carbonation get this deal tingling with oily sweetness that shows off a little booziness at times with something smack dab in the middle between dark chocolate/brown sugar toffee, molasses, and a bit of that dried prune again. Finish is a little tighter than I would expect and maybe a little more weight would make it absolutely perfect.  This one has earned its standing among the elite American megastouts. Meaty, beaty, big & bouncy doesn't cover it. No body fat on this one. Packs a punch in deep, dark roasted malt but a little slate and patent tannin works with the aggressive hops to balance down the residual sweetness while not rendering it comatose. There's accessible complexity here with a lightness, not a clamminess...to make it extremely drinkable. Thoroughly enjoyed this one.\"}\n",

Sorry guys, I know you grow this in Schijndel where the brewery is situated but this is far from delicate hops in type( listed Taurus) and in taste as this bitterness hangs for ages and has no peak. Far from fine arome though noticable or is it? Further actually not that bad, well carbonated, some maltyness and quiet strong alcohol taste and nose.

Rusted ruby with slow bubbles and a small head.   What happened to the aroma? My sniffer is just fine today, so it seems the aromas have up and died with the chickens. There are incredibly small traces of cherry licorice, alcohol and malty sweetness...otherwise not much else to report.  Flavor isn't much better. Best characteristic is a creamy sweetness like that of real vanilla ice cream (half of the credit claimed by the light, velvety texture). There's a heartier, bigger flavor trying to come through, that syrupy, sweet, boozy base you'll get in a good barleywine. But nothing knocks me over the head and reveals this as a killer of anything. And that's what I want in an American Barleywine. Finishes with some cherry/vanilla tart/sweet elements. Again, the mouthfeel is nice: smooth, fluffy and creamy, somewhat reminding of steamed milk.   For all the boasting on the label ('revolutionary\", \"will someday define America's unique BW style'), this hardly stands a chance against 100 other better US Barleywines. Maybe they mean 'someday, when we actually brew a killer barleywine...' Best thing about it is that the 10% alcohol hides with rest of the expected flavors. And the flashes of vanilla ice cream are nice. But considering the style, this is surprisingly, disappointingly Blah.\"}\n",

The label has a lot of other good information as well: 'World's Oldest Brewery\", \"Store and keep cool 46-52 F,' 'Brewed under the purity law of 1516.' The last one is news to me as I was not aware that the Reinheitsgebot allowed for the use of wheat in the brewing process.  I poured this into a weizen glass. A moderate pour gives off a massive five-finger head, making a roughly 1:1 ratio of head to beer. The head is fluffy and retention is excellent. It does eventually settle, but never recedes completely. A narrow trail of foamy lacing spans of the glass. Carbonation is visible. The beer is golden and cloudy. It looks like the perfect glass of beer that they pour in every beer commercial on television (with some added cloudiness per style).  The aroma is giving off scents of lemon and wheat. Mild tropical fruit and heavy yeastiness next reach the nose. Light phenols waft into the nose with just the slightest noticeable hint of alcohol. Aromatics are strong and this beer's fragrance is easily detected from the other side of the table.  As this is the prototypical hefeweizen, all of the standard traits of the style are present in the flavor. There's the banana ester. There's a nice crisp wheat bite. There's a dry finish, and a yeasty aftertaste. It is a well balanced and very deliciously full flavored beer.  The beer is medium bodied and much heavier than commercial American takes on the style. Carbonation is on the lighter end for a hefeweizen but I find it to be perfect. The carbonation agitates the flavors nicely making the beer satisfyingly lively in the mouth.  Beer doesn't get much more drinkable than this. It's full flavored and well balanced with no off-putting bitterness. It has a wonderful weight in the mouth. The alcohol content is a moderately low 5.4% ABV; and for an import with such high esteem, this is very reasonably priced. I would gladly tip back another if only there was another to be had. I just wish that I could get them fresher.  ---  The Two-Schlitz Scale: (see my profile for an explanation) Schlitz may have been the beer that made Milwaukee famous, but Weihenstephaner is older than Milwaukee itself. I enthusiastically give two Schlitz for this excellent hefeweizen.\"}\n",

One thing I've never ever done, however, is stop in at the Port Townsend Brewery to check it out and/or have a beer. I decided to rectify that issue. I ran in, picked up a bottle of their stout and their scottish, and ran out.  Apperance: Gorgeous, deep ruby color but absolutely no head. It's to the point where I'm almost shaking the bottle as it pours into the glass, while I desperately try to raise a head out of it, but it's no go. My birthstone is ruby, which I've always found kind of lame, but if this color could be my birthbeer color, I'd be all over it.  Smell: A wee hint of peat in the nose, but totally dominated by the malty sweetness. Not too shabby...  Taste: Huh. Almost has a weird porter-esque quality to it. I expected a real peaty front end, but actually got roasted barley instead. I'm a bit confused by the whole thing. The maltiness is nice and not overpowering, but does add the sensation that it's packing more ABV than it's stated 7%. A nice, alcoholic warming quality, that picks up the peat mantle just in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Well, I think this is where it falls flat. Very, very thin. Tastes like a keg beer served on cask, no bottle conditioning whatsoever. Like Charlton Heston said in 'Touch of Evil\\\", \"Dnde est el cuerpo?' (Ok, he didn't really say it, but he was playing a Mexican detective, so he could have.) I'm thinking the cuerpo fell victim to hand-bottling, so I'll have to revisit this bad boy at a later date.  Drinkability: It's not bad at all. The only thing preventing me from loving this is the fact that the body is so completely out of whack with what the beer should be.

The head rose up to just under two-fingers fairly quickly. It went down with moderately slow speed and left two stages of off-white lacing in the glass.  S - The aroma is so fresh it's reminiscent of picking my Cascade and Chinook hops; resins coating my fingers. Fresh and moist, the American-smelling hops are bursting at the seams like the way they are portrayed in the label art. Lots of resiny pine, a mellow grapefruit citrus, and a perfumy floral aroma. A slight herbal spice is hinted at too. The malts are buff too, giving the hop nose a solid backbone to rely on. A strong malty sweetness of caramel and honey with a flaky, biscuity nose. A small earthy wood hint is there from the oak foudres (I would assume). Very well balanced and aromatic without a slap to the face like most other DIPAs.  T - As the aroma suggests, this is both a more mellow but complex beer as well as being very nicely balanced. A sweet malty beginning of biscuits drizzled with honey is slowly overtaken by the oaky hop flavor. A lot of earthy notes pull out of it like the oak foudres, resiny pine-needle flavor, and floral and herbal hints. The citrusy grapefruit flavor is last to come across and is met with a bit of pineapple. Both leave a dryness in their stead that combats the sweet malts.  M - This full-bodied DIPA has a lot going on in the mouth. The sweetness rounds it out and balances it well as well as making it fairly smooth. The hops give the finish a nice dry feel and lingering moderate bitterness that seems to get more intense moments after the swallow. Nicely carbonated for a lively feel.  D - Another superb beer from Two Brothers, it's extremely well-crafted and delicious. One I was surprised to see and happy that I grabbed. A great sipper and a good beer to coax less hop-inclined drinkers into the world of DIPAs (as if they would start there anyway). I'll need to collect a few more on my next run south.\"}\n",

Big gurgle on the pour thanks to my unsteady hand; krausen-like head.  From the nose, I'm anticipating something juicy. Intense enough to be confused for a DIPA in most instances. Grapefruit juice, tangerines, the oils from the skins of both of those, along with a noticeable spiciness partially imparted by the yeast, but also by something floral that I can't really pinpoint. Dry malt in the background is a faint distraction.  More rindy then juicy like I anticipated. An absorbent bready beginning, white meat watermelon sweetness upfront, followed by an astringent, puckering bitterness, dusty wheat(is there wheat in here?), salt, & what seems like muted cayenne of all things.  Carbonation is mid range, but sizzles enough to cut the body some. Wheaty at times, & thicker then average.  Couldn't quite finish the growler in one shot. Still had a jug of rye to attack.

I love the peaceful imagery on the beer's label. Very nature-centric and shit - gotta love it! Oh, and this is the first beer of my evening, so no, I am not writing this drunk (yet).  Anyhow, this one pours the slightest bit hazy with a dark copper being the primary color. Hues of orange and blonde can be seen at times while a nice, fluffy  inch sits atop my Sammy Adams perfect pint glass. The head retention is average, leaving a nice halo with thin layer foaminess resting in its' center.  I get some freshly lemon and orange zest on the nose, followed by some pine. The pine may be leftover scents from the recent tree decorating madness, but it goes well in the nasal mix.  To my surprise, this tasted much better and richer than I was expecting after a fair amount of initial sniffing. The flavor is medium to full bodied for an IPA and medium to full body. I get a lingering dryness after drinking which added to the 'prolong=able' drinkability factor. I get a mix citrus hops and lightly toasted malts in the beginning with high carbonation throughout. It finishes slightly dry and resinous, as a well-crafted IPA should...  If I had more that this one, I can see myself putting about 4 of these away on any given night.

This isn't the hype-train, folks, and I have none of these for sale nor trade... that said...  The 22-ounce bomber bottle numbered 67 of 694 yields its golden crown with a soft hiss, and when poured into my D-R snifter ORF is a true thing of beauty. The brew is clear with an impossibly dark opaque heart, and is trimmed with a twinkle of smoky garnet at the edges. A thin, oily, sticky cap of dirty khaki-colored foam fluffs up before receding, leaving an extremely fine-bubbled smattering of lacing and ribbons of sticky legs clinging to the insides of the glass.  The aroma is rich, black, and bourbony; the 23-year-old Pappy Van Winkle barrels employed in the project really shine through the darkness. Underneath the spiritous aromatic fireworks show lies a layer of bakers' chocolate spiked with vanilla beans, all grounded in a touch of burnt caramel dusted with a liberal sprinkle of dark roast.   The taste is mouth-filling dark chocolate goodness incarnate with plenty of oak, vanilla, and Pappy. I didn't know that premium bourbon-filled dark chocolate truffles now officially existed in a liquid state, but I was uninformed, and as proof of same, I have a really kickass example sitting right here on the table in front of me. The flavors are rich, sweet, and savory with just enough dusty cocoa and expertly-crafted alcohol onboard to keep the chocolatey sweetness under-the-top. I'm damned stingy with 'five' grades for flavor, but I just don't know how it could taste any better, so as a dedicated a lover of well-crafted beer, fine liquor, imported chocolate, and products from my home state that rock, I'll give Steven, Paul, and Jamie's brew that five... with a bullet.  Likewise in perfection is the expertly-carbonated full body. It has heft without stickiness and a super-fine tracing of bubbles in solution that make it so. At 10.13% ABV, Olde Rabbit's Foot isn't something you could drink all day, but I'll put it as simply as I can, friends-- in a perfect world, my kitchen faucet would have three taps... labeled with the abbreviations 'H\", \"C', and 'ORF'.

FP is a unique and mind bending beer, and so was Sabbath, so...why not? Right. So why not...plus I could see myself drinking this series in a darkened room lit with candles and grooving along happily with some of Birmingham's finiest blasting from the stereo...quad even, man. Yeah.   A = 'Master of Reality'. Hazy, opaque pear skin/golden delicious apple shade of burnished gold/yellow. Thin and pure white head forms and fades slowly but leaves bubbly thick islands here and there, hither and dither. Now I truly believe that 'MoR' is only flawed by the inclusion of 'Children of The Grave', but I must relate that 'MoR' is the reason I took up bass guitar when I still played. Just about perfect, even, plus the Bill Ward vocal turn ('Solitude') is wonderful.  N = 'Sabotage'. Nice and funky-just like the album referenced. Strong farmhouse distinctions abound, with slightly sweet tones to the faint shades of fresh manure. Ripe and at peak fruits: pears, apples, peaches, and even some tropical notes of pineapple and banana. The blend of al of the aromas together is like having a fresh fruit picnic in a farmhouse yard during the peak of Spring.  T = 'Volume 4'. Much more forward flavor-wise than the previous 2 FP's I've had (not unlike the fact that V4 was a great leap forward for BS, in a way that was prepared for by'MoR' but V4 of course sealed the deal-just check 'Supernaught\", \"Tomorrow's Dream', and 'Snowblind'), this one also shows a good deal more fruit on the palate. Initial hop funkiness is met with big fruit (peaches in syrup, pear tart, stewed apples) and some sharp, almost angular white and black pepper notes that puncture the palate randomly in a very good way. Finish has some faded fruit and hops that fade out very slowly. Superb. Side note: Tim Morse, ex-drummer of AC, had a funny story regarding V4: he once told that if AC were ever asked to contribute to a Black Sabbath tribute, they would insist on doing a piece off of V4. Which one, you might ask? Why, 'F/X' of course!   M = 'Black Sabbath'. Tingly, prickly carbonation (hits you just the way 'N.I.B.' does after 'A Bit Of Finger'). Good lusciousness throughout; almost honeylike in its smooth and enveloping manner. Long, clean finish. Lovely.  D = 'Live In Paris 1970' (video/film = the best BS I've seen, even better than the footage from 'Beat Club' on German TV). The best FP I've had yet in the series, and since I've compared the previous two to other Belgian brews, I'll say that this one would be the FP version of St. Bernardus Triple. The fruit and pepper qualities give this one a Burgundy-styled, California-made Chardonnay thing going on. Excellent and well worth your time...just like the Paris footage.

Poured from the 750ml. cork finished brown bottle, into my 0.4 litre Rastal crystal goblet, a murky dark brown viscous liquid with nearly two-fingers of ivory bubbly foam. The foam settles quickly to 1/4', leaving some slippery lace that spots.  The nose is very sweet and spicy, reminds me most of ginger and corriander. It's very pleasant ...full of malt, sweet dextrose, yeasty Brettanomyces aroma and some waivering notes of alcohol. If I didn't know better, I'd swear this was from Belgium, seriously.  The taste being much like the smell, this stuff has a wonderful spicy flavor, much like a Christmas Ale to the likes of Anchor's seasonal brew. A nice little burnish on the tongue with a sweet, spicy lingering finish with some warming.

A nice head and a colour that is passable for, but not completely, black. It is almost rather a deep brown and exposed by ruby chestnut highlighting. You can go ahead and cross out the usual adjectives of 'viscous\", \"oily' and 'thick'. The colours are dark enough to prevent clarity, but still this appearance definitely will draw the ferociousness of this stout into question.   The aroma offers up a long list of pleasant and welcome smells: dark licorice, brewers anise, oats, and light coffee. It is missing two things however: chocolate and roast. I like it but I'm not wowed by it. Unfortunately for Coast Brewing I usually hold the smell of my RIS to a standard of how much it wows me, not simply how pleasant I find it. A great RIS will 'wow' you.   The taste is really neat and provides a few layers of flavour. The first adds a little spice. It is hops, and good supply of them. The taste rings out, not as leafy, but as the actual green leafs themselves. It almost becomes tea like at times. The second is a brilliant profile that pits chocolate and roast along side big, juicy dark berries. Currants, blueberries, and lots and lots of blackberry taste.   What might be a big gooey chocolaty mouthfeel is choked out by either the alcohol or hop bitterness. I can't be positive which, but something has become very obnoxious with warming. The 9.3% is subtle, but not as well integrated into the beer as with other Imperial Stouts.   I know those in South Carolina are over-joyed and excited that the silly alcohol cap law has finally been lifted off their breweries. I think it's something brewers are equally ecstatic about; Coast Brewing's decision to brew the Blackbeerd is evidence of that.   I think, however, they are still in the process of learning the craft of new styles and in particular, the high-gravity arts. This did not 'wow' me, regardless of its many strong points, and neither did their hefty IPA. I think the raving reviews their beers have gotten are more a reflection of a proud and delighted native populace who are deliriously happy their thirst for bigger, better beers is finally being quenched by someone local. Good on them for the support.   I don't wish to put the beer nor its brewers down - I enjoyed it, how could you not? In fact, I'd really love to see a larger batch of this in the future. I'd certainly try to obtain a bottle, maybe even a second, for sharing, to return the favour to my good friend Grub!\"}\n",

Even repetitive, hard swirling could not generate any foam. It would, however, drape panes of brown coloured coating all where it touched. Opaque. A sexy, oil black colour.  The aroma is dense and full-bodied. Huge notes of chocolate, coffee, anise, and roasted - nay, charred - malts. It's a lavish smell, everything is so full and immodest.   Flavours coat the mouth thoroughly with a strong, charred bitterness. So present are the roasted dark malts, black licorice and espresso, that you can almost feel them staining your teeth. They coat the entire mouth, including the roof and to the back of the throat as well. The aftertaste is sweet, just like eating a brownie. Where is the alcohol hiding in this one?   The taste is quite an extravagance. Strong, decadent chocolate (mousse, truffle, bakers, syrup, all of the above) as well as hazelnut, anise, and espresso. Very, very chocolaty with a strong, bitter espresso taste. The finish is a twisted blend of anise and chewing tobacco. Quite an elaborate blend of such straight forward flavours.   This stout has earned the use of 'American' in its title. If there's anything the Americans like to do it's take something and make it bigger and better and more lavish. I took a course in modern art history with a brilliant Prof who in a lecture reflected on just this. At the conclusion of the Second World War, the U.S was the only major power still with half their pre-war GDP. Unlike a poor, indebted and destroyed Europe, Americans could afford luxuries, which was reflected in the design of their commodities. Even the example she would use - toasters - could illustrate how American designs symbolized attitude and indicated prosperity.   Indeed, Kuhnenn's American Imperial Stout is an example of just that. The amount of malt is an almost gluttonous level, the chocolate and espresso is beyond decadence and the alcohol reaches a staggering 13.50%!!!   I've described this beer using words like 'decadent\", \"lavish', and 'extravagant'. Indeed it was. Especially to pair it with dessert like we did, this beer is gratifying, it was...pure indulgence.

But one element that is a constant no matter what, one golden rule of brewing: weissbiers must have a large, fluffy, pillowy head. There's no exceptions. A weissbier that fails to have that fails period.   Besides its disgracefully flat surface - there's not even a sign of lacing, not a single bubble in sight! - the beer's rigidly hazed body doesn't exactly make for the prettiest looking thing anyhow. Its tarnished lemon-skin tone is, unlike most in the style, without even the slightest of sunny, shimmering highlight. It's U-G-L-Y and it ain't go no alibi, it's ugly.   Likewise, its aroma falls dreadfully far from the mark with regards to style. The bouquet of a German weissbier is a hard thing to mess up if brewed properly: hell, you just pitch the yeast and let it do all the work. Phenols that smell of clove and spice and esters that resemble banana, citrus and bubblegum come standard with all German weiss strains.  Which makes me wonder what ingredients were used - the label assures it's brewed according to the Reinheitsgebot which means it uses only four ingredients (water, malt, hops, yeast) but that doesn't necessarily ensure they're *good quality* ingredients.   The taste confirms they couldn't have been - as well as possessing no phenols or esters to note, it holds very little grainy, malty flavour or texture worth mentioning either. German weissbiers, even the lesser ones, tend to at least have a grainy, wheat-centered taste that is only more invigorating than it is distinctive and palatable.  As mentioned already, there isn't even a trickle of vanilla or banana or citrusy flavour. Par for the course; there isn't the least bit of a creamy, fluffy sensation nor is there even an adequately brisk carbonation. There is nothing really, less a drop of honey smudged onto a cracker, which leads me to believe they've skimped out on the wheat.   I didn't think a bad German weissbier was possible - the mere sound of it strikes me as perhaps the ultimate oxymoron, better even than 'unbiased opinion\", \"peace force' or 'virtual reality'. There's an awful lot of things that make this style so wonderful - it's light and refreshing, spicy and effervescent, layered with flavour and distinctly attractive. Erdinger Weissbier, incredibly, fails to exhibit even one of those qualities.\"}\n",

From the bottle: 'Stag Series # 3 was brewed with a blend of beechwood and cherrywood smoked malts to create a twist on our interpretation of a traditional Franconian Rauchbier'.  Stag Series, eh? It's Stag Night at the Woodman's and the strippers are here in bounteous abundance! A sheet has been stretched across the living room wall and my buddy, Larry, is screening 8mm films for everyone not otherwise engaged. A poker game (or two) (or more) is going on the basement and some of the guys have gone up to the attic with some muggles they scored at a jazz club earlier in the week. Dig this crazy groove, baby!  Hey, I dig the style descriptor, but its origins in the 1500s should be made clearer. I though that it was earlier, but that may just be me. We are talking the Middle Ages, though, a time of plague and pestilence and fear of death was rampant. The worst thing that could happen to a brewster was the presence of rodents, which would mean that the malt would have to be destroyed. Think of the first few lines of the nursery rhyme, 'This Is the House That Jack Built' - the cat killed the rat that ate the malt that sat in the house that Jack built. Larry Bell is still solvent because he scored some malt on the cheap, showing its value even today. They knew that smoking meats and cheeses not only preserved them, but it also detracted rodents, since the smell of smoke was one of fire and danger to them. They began smoking malt to ward off rodents, only to find that the smokiness of the malt was imparted to the beer. Thus, a style was born.  My pour resulted in two rocky fingers of light-tan head with moderate retention. Color was a deep-ruby with NE-quality clarity. F'in' beautiful! Nose was pungent with cedar wood smoke, very evocative of a campfire, lovely. Mouthfeel was medium, but the taste was heavenly. If you have had smoked Gouda cheese, you will be able to conjure the taste of this beer. I began to look around to make sure that nothing was actually on fire. My sinuses were filled with a smoky woodiness and my taste buds were tying to cope with the smokiness inherent in this beer. The finish tasted like dragon's breath - raw, smoky, fiery, just as it should be. Limited!?! Shame on you! This should be a Fall seasonal (at least).\"}\n",

At this year's barleywine rollout party at the Farmville brewery, sitting side-by-side with a three-year vertical setup of luscious barleywines was a keg of that same succulent Milk Stout, only this variant of the elixir in question was turbo-boosted by a brief encounter with the inside of a bourbon barrel! Woo Hoo! Barkeep, make mine a Barrel-Aged Milk Stout, please!  In a Duck-Rabbit logoed shaker pint glass, the brew glows a deep, dirty garnet when held to the bright sunshine, and is capped with a soft pillow of pale beige foam. Thin wisps of lacing on the glass mark the passing sips.  To be perfectly honest, the aroma of the drink was nearly lost amidst the perfume of yeasty maltiness and the mild essence of sanitizer wafting through the brewery, but what did come through loud and clear was a note of sweet oak and a drizzle of Bourbon-laced chocolate syrup.  The taste? Yes the taste. The flavor of this beer is what that 'But' was all about! Goodness, gracious, I loved the mild malt-chocolatey bittersweetness of the original, but given a ride on the oak, Milk Stout takes a quantum leap from 'Pretty Damned Good' to 'Damned-Near Perfect'! The chocolatey character still holds center stage, but aromatic oak and mellow bourbon contribute more layers of vanilla-like sweetness and a brisk note of alcohol that dries the finish and cools the palate.  A lady in front of me in the beer line asked the brewer, Paul Phillipon, how much a six-pack of the brew would cost her at the store. Our gracious host smiled and told her that the beer wasn't for sale... just for special occasions... but maybe one day.... As we walked away from the tap-table with fresh glasses in hand, I overheard the lady whispering to her companions, 'I don't know why they wouldn't bottle this!

Light coffee weaves in and out of dark chocolate that's drizzled with molasses. Black cherries and raisins add a low and dark fruity nature to this imperial stout. A rich caramel malt sweetness gives a good balance to the exceptional nose. Some toffee, mocha, and vanilla notes also aid in the massive complexity of this amazing nose.  T - Thick, robust roasted malts coat the tongue in a beautiful malty glory. Like the aroma, the flavor is vastly complex. Molasses, chocolate chunks, coffee bean, caramel cube, and a toasted bread malt flavor make up much of what I get. Then toffee, mocha, and vanilla bean all wander in like a dribble of coffee creamer. The potent alcohol that's noticeable instantly on the first sip, just seems to fade away. This is one of the most exceptional flavors I've had the pleasure of tasting.  M - Rich and chewy, it's a beyond-full-bodied brew that coats the throat all the way down like syrup. The carbonation is perfectly balanced to deliver a smooth drinking experience. With it being low, it also explains the lack of a larger head.  D - Between the flavor and mouthfeel...well, hell...every aspect of this beer, it's probably one of, if not THE, best beers I've ever had in my life. And for the price, it's damn near impossible to beat. I want to buy a case and I want to buy it now.\"}\n",

Since I knew this beer was commonplace in the iceboxes of my grandparents I felt compelled to purchase it. I was so offended to see this beer in 40oz. form that I almost walked out of the store empty-handed. But, upon venturing into the back refrigerated room of my liquor store I decided to pick up a 'specialty priced' $11.99 (before tax and can return) 30 rack up for my next party. Well, that didn't go as good as I hoped it to. After countless comments like 'whats schaefer?\", \"I hope this stuff was on sale', and 'ewww this is the worst tasting beer i've ever had' it was demoted to the late night beer-pong table. This beer pours a serene gold color, with similar characteristics to the outside can. When poured into a glass, an artificially thick pearly white head forms over the beer and lasts much longer than the average beer drinker would want. The first taste of this (especially when room temperature or warmer) is of utter mystery. I remember asking myself 'did I just enjoy this, or not?'. The reason why I had this question repeating in my mind was because before this I had been drinking Budweiser and I found Schaefer to be comparable to Budweiser in many dimensions and yet it is alot cheaper. The design of the can is very 'half-ass', no fancy words like budweiser (clean, crisp, pure). A barley stem is pictured on the side of this product along with the words 'schaefer' in red and 'union made' in small black letters (wow that makes me feel alot better haha). Overall this beer is not bad when deciding on a cheap beer to be used in some form of a drinking game, but in no way that reminiscent beer of the past that I was expecting.\"}\n",

Poured from a real man's 500ml bottle into a real man's Stein, word man.  A: First off - this beer looks really flat, no head to be seen. The body is golden with a hue of Papaya whip (yes I got a colour wheel now!).  S: First whiff is a mixture between base malt grains and rubber... yeah I'm not looking forward to where the rubber odor leads. There are cut grass hops in there with a distinct (if you could call it that) water overtone, this brings it back from the verge of odd and places the aroma profile in the realm of 'refreshing lager'... we'll see.  T: And we're back in Marzen territory; lager grains with a slight cloying sweetness and a crisp dry hopped finish. There is a sour yeast note that is much more pronounced than in the Lowenbrau Marzen and the finish is drier, however there is less sweetness here. Overall not bad but I'm not writing home to mum about this (or any beer for that matter - my mum doesn't drink and has zero interest in beer reviews).  M: Not sure if this borders on watery or not - it's a strange allusion with this brew because of the wateriness of the aroma and flavour, however the body is slightly cloying... let's just say that it's lighter than the Lowenbrau.  D: Deciding factor is the flavour with this brew and I think the Lowenbrau Oktoberfest/Marzen shows a bit more finesse. Whereas this beer is taking several wild swings ('Yeast!\", \"Sugar!\", \"Dry!\", \"Crisp!'), Lowenbrau is by comparison 'floating like a butterfly, stinging like a bee', and to me finesse and style will always defeat brute force.  Food match: German food, yeah that's been established before, what else? German beer is pretty versatile in my opinion; how about a classic porterhouse steak (medium rare) with a side of celeriac mash and carrots braised au jus? Is this beer good enough for a decent meal (aka is it up to the challenge?), well only YOU can answer that question.\"}\n",

The foamy two inch head slowly collapses, etching the glass with permanent lace.  Smell: One word says it: Wow! This is the most amazingly and powerfully aromatic beer I have ever experienced. As soon as the bottle is opened, it starts. After it hits the glass....there is an aroma cloud that envelops a 2 ft area around the pour. The smell is incredible. Pineapple, mango, peach, honey, grapefruit, and pine. I could smell this all day.  Taste: The taste blows me away. A changing flavor profile throughout the experience is quite unique. The first taste is all pine and bitter. The next several sips highlight the honey and grapefruit. Then some malt. Each sip has flavors to savor. Flavors mellow and get more floral as it warms. Very complex.  Mouthfeel: Medium with a pleasant oily feeling left on the roof of the mouth from the hop resins.  Drinkability: Superb. You would never know this weighs in at 10% ABV. Each sip has me muttering things like 'ahhhh\", \"amazing' and 'incredible'. Very few beers do that. Very few.  Overall: Despite all the hype....there is definitely a reason with this one. This has got to be my favorite beer...definitely in the top 2 no doubt. Bell's has done a great job here. If not for the ABV...I could drink these all day long. I was lucky enough to procure a case worth of these and will be spacing them out nicely over the next month or so. Even my wife (not a big beer fan) loved this one. Sadly, while I wish this was available year-round...at least there will be Bell's Two-Hearted Ale to fill in the gap. Get this beer if you have not tried it while it is still available.\"}\n",

I take a mighty whiff and all really get is an assload of wheat, not much else at all. I was expecting more maltiness, more syrup, more anything, but only wheat comes through to me. Maybe it's just me. I dunno. A darker version of this comes through in the taste. It's like what Mark Knopfler puts forth ('Sultans of Swing' is kicking my ass right now) about 'Guitar George\": \"It's strictly rhythm: he doesn't wanna make it cry or sing.' Indeed, dark wheat and not much else populate the flavor profile. It's not bad, but not very unique or interesting either.

The color was an oh-so-slightly hazy golden-yellow. Nose was pure, unadulterated lager with its attendant sweetness and no adjuncts standing in its way. I would have inhaled it if it would not have really put a serious strain on my sinuses, so I decided to drink it, which is generally the preferred method in a review. Mouthfeel was medium and I picked up a grassy Saaz hoppiness on the tongue in addition to the characteristic lager sweetness noted on the nose. Finish was quite dry and I believe that I have hit upon a new winner! Given some previous reviewers' remarks about a relatively low price, this would definitely be a Hula in the Coola Day (01 Feb, annually) if for no other reason than its colorful CAN and it would be an attraction at the beach for its curiosity.

Sweet malt at the front, fusel alcohol quite evident, bubble gum, earthy and a Hoot to sniff as always, with the start scrumptiously sweet, thick malt, the top is middling in feel to the palate.

The pour a deep crystal clear garnet, the head 'missing', the lace, AWOL, but I am going to like it anyway. Nose is earthy, nut sweet, caramel, lightly toasted grains. Front is malt, the top skimpy, the finish is kindly acidic, sparingly hopped, the aftertaste parched, slightly alcohol bitter. About 3 seconds after you take your first swallow, the 'Tummy Warming' commences, ah the pleasures 0f 14% ABV.

Although it doesn't smell like honey, I wonder if honey was added. Since Estes Park already has a honey beer (Stinger Wild Honey Wheat), I doubt it.  Staggering Elk is not your typical American macro lager. In fact, I don't think it's an AML at all. The brewery calls it an 'export style lager' (by which I'm guessing they mean a Dortmunder) but it doesn't strike me as one of those either. Whatever it is, it isn't good beer.  The flavor profile is dominated by a grainy sweetness. Dare I use the word 'corny'? It almost tastes like a low-ABV (4.6%) malt liquor. I get almost nothing in the way of hops and no hint of any sort of complementary flavors, much less complexity. Words that come to mind include 'drab\", \"dull', and 'lackluster'.  The mouthfeel seems more full than it really is due to the lack of carbonation. Not a complete lack, but the bubbles that are present give up as soon as they hit the tongue. A more exciting, invigorating mouth presence might have helped the taste and drinkability scores a little, but it couldn't have saved a beer that's this far beyond salvation.  Is the elk staggering because he's been shot by a big-game hunter or because he's had too much to drink? The dancing, singing, mug-wielding creatures on the label would suggest the latter.

The bee juice contributes flavor and an ideal amount of balancing sweetness, in addition to whatever pale malt sweetness is present. Hoppiness is on the tame side for an APA, which allows the beer to achieve an easy, pleasureable sweet-bitter balance. Honey-dipped grapefruit wedges?  Even though I can't identify any specific spices, it tastes like something out of the ordinary is present. The beer tastes more herbal than spicy to me. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that coriander is one of the secret ingredients. The flavor deepens with warming, so if you really want to appreciate the best this summer brew has to offer, don't drink it too cold.  The mouthfeel is summer beer light, along with being soft and feathery. That combination increases drinkability exponentially. I usually have a swallow or two left at this point in my reviews.

This has a chance to be solid beer.  Black Jack Porter is a pretty straightforward version of the style. That doesn't mean that it's bad beer, just that it isn't 'robust\", \"full-bodied' or 'complex', as seen on the label. Then again, name more than a handful of 6.5% American porters that are any of those.  Specifics include charred cacao nibs, dark caramel, black coffee, and hints of citrus zest. Good sweet-bitter balance, slightly favoring the latter, especially on the back end. A light tanginess adds yet another interesting facet. This really is well-rounded, enjoyable ale of the roasted malty sort.  The mouthfeel is beginning to fill out a tad with warming. It's at least medium for the style and the bubbles help more than hinder. Don't drink BJP too cold or you won't experience it at its best.  The Brew Kettle does a very nice job with hoppy beer like Red Eye PA and Old 21 Imperial IPA. Black Jack Porter is just as good (even though it would be trounced by Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald) and is a worthwhile pick-up if you like well-crafted American porters.

Well I figured I'm going to try review every beer I can get my grubby little hands on (actually my hands are quite clean and average sized).

Poured from a 375ml can (or 'tinnie') into a cheap, cheap 500ml pokal (no use tainting my nice glassware).  A: This is the probably the only good thing I will say about VB; it has a decent enough translucent amber body. There was a centimeter white head which fizzled down to nothing, leaving ne'er a trace of lace.  S: Smells like a trash bag full of musty grains and corn that had been left in the cupboard to dry for three months... with a hint of sugarcane sweetness. No hops. None.  T: Tastes as bad as I remember it, so at least they've managed some consistency over the years; the front palate has elements of a cider without the goodness of apples, it's slightly sweet with a mineral water element, but in the back notes is where it really messes with (and promptly takes a crap on) your taste buds; the hops in this beer give it a tangy bitter bite without any herbaceous or fruit characters and you are left with this aftertaste not unlike the one you would get if you licked a damp sewer rat.   M: Watery and far too fizzy.  D: I'm not exactly sure how to describe how much of a disaster this beer is... it fails epically on so many levels... just to illustrate how bad VB really is here is a list of colloquial names that this brew is called across our fine nation: 'Vomit Beer\", \"Visitors Beer' (for the plethora of migrants who drink it), 'Green Death\", \"Dirty Rotten Vic' or my personal favourite 'Vaginal Backwash'. You have been warned!  Food match: Slightly raw sewer rat with sauted cat hair balls if we were going for a flavour profile match, otherwise to save your taste buds from the trauma of VB I would recommend the hottest buffalo wings you can find... trust me on that.

Its spotless clarity and deep tone of gold do not personify the beer's nauseating and raunchy character, I can assure you. Likewise, its white head may look pristine but the industrially-produced, chemical-filled, adjunct-ridden beer beneath it is anything but.   'Vic Bitter' has forever marketed itself as an unpretentious, blue-collar, working man's beer and, indeed, it smells like a big, sweaty fat man would after a long day's work under a hot sun. Even dripping with perspiration, dehydrated, exhausted from a full day of outdoor labour I doubt I could drink this. This is so bad it could turn even raccoons away.   VB is affectionately known as 'Vitamin B', ironic considering the beer is evidently deficient of malt. It is full, rather, of industrial adjuncts and chemical fillers, the smell of which is as repulsive as (and conjures to mind) green mold. And, truth be told, I'd just as soon take my chances with that than risk finishing this; I think a Tetanus shot might be a good idea.  It is foul and off-putting and far from refreshing. The rawness and unpleasantness of its taste, which is like corn syrup gone bad, is heinously cloying and wickedly wretched on the palate. The fact that it's gone easy on the bubbles only makes things worse; this horrid flavour just sits on the tongue like a filthy pigeon stooped on a ledge. This may have alcohol in it but, believe me, it's a uniquely sobering experience...   I'm told that the Aussies joke that VB stands for 'Vomit Bomb\", \"Vaginal Backwash' or 'Very Bad', none of which come close to accurately portraying the horribleness that is this monstrosity of a beer (but, if I had to chose, I'd say that 'Vomit Bomb' probably comes the closest).

You have a solid lager, but a DIPA needs to have some hop character, of which there is none here. A drinkable libation, but a total failure as to the style.

Enjoy! {Incidentally, I corrected the places where words are separated without dashes to indicate, such as 'understand', and 'contemnplate\"}  This was written by mental deficients, and conceived by them, as well. I hope it wasn't brewed by them, as well. Here we gointo a snifter style glass.   Rich rubyness, tight off-white head. Big, bold, and pungent aromatics. Beefed-up and all that rich toffee-ness, and all bitterness of an outrageous hop bomb. Reminds me of a barleywine, more than a double IPA. Or maybe that's where we are these days, with the blurring of the lines. Give this to me blind, and I'd definitely call it a barleywine, not double IPA.  Let's drink! Boom! Ah! Bam! Ooof! Ow! A full-on assault, no respite, no relief, no subtleties, or nothing. Thick, and huge, and abrasively bitter. Nothing but everything is in here, and it boom-shaka-lakka, blasts everything in it's path. Brash, indelicate, and over-bearing.   Full-bodied, full, long finish, but too, too everything. This is a roller coaster ride. One minute it's loud, next it's cool, then it's bubbling, bitter soup that confuses the palate. I should like this, card-carrying hop-head that I am, but one has to be discriminating, and here's where I discriminate.\"}\n",

It's an industrial region built on coal and steel formerly shipped down the Ruhr to the Rhine.  Despite the pollution of it's former industry, Schwelm is cleaning itself up, and it's still surrounded by beautiful forest regions. It's also a fairly cultural area, due in great part to the high pay rates its employees once received. The area is growing once again, and it stradles the line between modern and traditional. The beers of the Brauerei Schwelm reflect that.   The Schwelmer Pils pours a clear golden body beneath a short head of thin but creamy bright white froth that holds well and leaves some nice lace about the glass.  Its nose is more impressive than its appearance with a decidedly malty character that's backed by floral and spicy hops. The malt appears first, doughy, bready, yeasty, and biscuity. Then the hops appear seemingly from nowhere, offering a breath of fresh summer air that balances the malt and rounds it out.  It's lightly crisp in the mouth with a delicate, fine-bubbled, and moderate carbonation that cuts through its medium-light body nicely. There's just enough to perk up the tastebuds and leave it refreshing.  The flavor delivers the same doughy and bready maltiness that the aroma suggests, but it's far from sweet as it's backed by a firm bitterness and solid spicy hop notes. It finishes calmly, with crust of bready malt and a swirl of hop flavors that fade to a lingering bitterness.  Overall it's quite nice; more refined, quaint, and 'relaxed\", \"country-like', or 'antique' than the bristling golden examples from Northern Germany.\"}\n",

Certainly is mahogany - I'll have to rate this as average.  Smell is that of burnt/toast malts (munich), almost like old coffee somewhat.

Definitely don't feel this beer so far. A few more sips and it doesn't improve much. Some bitterness at the end from the hops but the flavor doesn't appeal to me. I'm going to have to give this a below average score on taste. It isn't completely awful or devoid of taste, just doesn't appeal to me.  Mouthfeel is somewhat strange. Almost soapy, then an aftertaste of burnt coffee / hops hit you at end. Definitely not a mouthfeel I like. I wouldn't mind it so much if it wasn't so strange to experience.  Drinkability is poor for me. I had to pour out this beer without finishing it - I can't tolerate drinking something that tastes like coffee grounds - and wouldn't order this beer again unless it changed majorly.

The nose is clean as well and is well-balanced. I like a little more hoppiness in my pales, but this one isn't too bad. Some citrus fruit is present, as is something more flowery. I'm guessing that close to 100% pale malt is in use because there's very little aroma contribution on that end.  This is a solid APA that is enjoyable even though it doesn't really stand out from the crowd. It's adequately malted with, again, very little malty flavor transfer. Hop flavor is sort of laid back; hop bitterness is a little more feisty. I can appreciate the white grapefruitiness of the Cascade. The addition of the others (Cluster, Hallertau) gives the flavor profile more facets.   Some organic beer has a flavor that I find objectionable and that I'm usually unable to adequately describe. 'Clay\", \"an unpleasant earthiness\", \"vegetal' are some of the words and phrases that I've used in the past. I'm happy to report that this organic beer is 100% free of such off-flavors.  There isn't much to report with regard to the mouthfeel. It's pale ale medium with no trace of wateriness on the back end. I have no complaints about the middle-of-the-road carbonation either.  Wolaver's Pale Ale is a good effort (and I won't even say 'for an organic beer'). It's a pretty solid drinker that, nevertheless, will never make me forget the truly good versions of the style.

The beige cap was one finger to start, lasted but a few minutes and left little more than dribs and drabs of lace. The appearance score has everything to do with the gorgeous sunburst that was the beer... and essentially ignores the less than stunning head.  The nose could have been more aromatic. Although, to be fair, it did become more bold with warming. My impressions were recorded in three simple words in my notes: 'toasted\", \"fruity', and 'orange'. I'm well aware that oranges are fruit, so I guess that's only two impressions instead of three. I hoped this 'dubbel-style abbey ale' would have more going for it on the palate...  ... and it definitely did. It took a few ounces to nail down the exact comparison, but I must have been happy with the final result since I wrote very little after that. Fallen Angel tasted like candied oranges drizzled with caramel and light molasses (dark candi sugar was used) and rolled in clove-spiced toast crumbs.  I have the utmost respect for wdmrock's brewing talent (tasting is believing), but that didn't stop me from wondering whether he was capable of creating an authentic Belgian dubbel. Make that 'a credible recreation of' an authentic Belgian dubbel. While Fallen Angel is no Westvleteren 8 (what is?), it did taste like the real deal; albeit a lighter than usual real deal.   Forget all that, though. I didn't really care how authentic or inauthentic it was. The most important thing was that it was delicious beer that became more complex and even more delicious as the ounces disappeared. It was wonderfully sweet and spicy (I'll bet that an authentic yeast strain was used), with a mild, hoppy tightening on the finish.  I wish the mouthfeel had risen to the occasion. It was a fraction too light and the carbonation was too bright. That combination is okay for a pilsener or a kolsch, but not for a dubbel. I like them bigger, softer and creamier. Come to think of it, a cask version would probably kick ass.  Fallen Angel is the second outstanding ale that I've had in as many days from Rock Bottom. I've said it before and I'll say it again: I can't believe months go by without me seeing the inside of the best damn brewpub in Des Moines. I like the beer's name, but it doesn't fit. Long before I saw the bottom of the pint glass, I knew this Angel was heavenly.\"}\n",

My notes say only 'bright\", \"balanced\", \"grain' and 'possibly citrus'. I went back to it again and again, but didn't gain anything else as it warmed.  Wow! Happy Pilz is probably the most bitter beer that I've ever had at this brewpub. I can't say that it was unbalanced, though, because there was just enough underlying pils malt to take the sharpest edges off the alpha acid buzzsaw. Once I tasted it, I was even more amazed that I couldn't smell much.  I took a guess on the style, picking German Pilsener over Czech Pilsener because I thought the hops tasted more like Hallertau than Saaz. Of course, I'm probably way off-base. (Note: wdmrock has just informed me that American Magnum, a Hallertau variant, was used). The malt side of the flavor profile reminded me of barely toasted, sun-ripened grain rolled in granulated sugar. That isn't to say the beer was sweet. Far from it.  Ten tons o' hops swamped over my tongue, delivering such flavors as lemongrass, bitter greens, sourdough bread crust and a sprinking of dried herbs and shaved grapefruit peel. The finish was snappy, but it wasn't overly clean due to...  ... a mouthfeel that featured an impressive hop oil linger. A body that was a few clicks more full than medium (for the style) contributed to the long finish. The carbonation was abundant, yet was so fine as to be manageable. In fact, I liked the tongue tingle.  This beer won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it will be if you're a dyed-in-the-wool hophead. It's another in a long line of quality offerings from what I believe is Iowa's best brewpub. I'm sure some people need happy pills to get through the day.

It looked as though a solid sheet of lace would be deposited, but the glass ended up displaying thin, feathery rings that marked each mouthful.  The aroma was too laid back initially. Despite becoming a little bolder with warming, it never did stand out like the rest of the beer. My notes read 'lightly toasted\", \"fruity hops\", \"slightly sweet', and 'nice balance'. That pretty much covers it.  The flavor score was not an easy call and wasn't settled on until the trip home from Rock Bottom. The reason for the 4.5 is that Goat-Toppler is the best maibock that I've ever had. Any beer (of a style that I don't normally care for) that can impress me this much deserves to be rewarded.  This maibock/helles bock was slightly darker than the typical maibock/helles bock. It wasn't as dark as a bock, but was at least halfway there. That's what happens when the malt bill contains Vienna and Munich is addition to pale. The flavor profile was made up of whole grain toast drizzled with dark honey, assorted herbs and spices, and a shaving of bitter orange rind.  Since no herbs or spices were added, that aspect of the flavor profile must have been due to the Summit and Mt. Hood hops. Although the bitterness of the hops added yet another dimension, the beer was all about the contrast between sweet and spicy. Not too sweet and not too spicy, but juuust right.  Thanks to the generous amount of malt sugars and the close-to-perfect carbonation, the mouthfeel was outstanding as well. No wimpy lagers here. The beer was medium-full for the style, with tremendous volume and big, graceful, rounded edges.  Is goat-toppling like cow-tipping? I have never toppled a goat, but there are goats that topple themselves. Google 'fainting goats' and watch the videos. It seems that the poor creatures fall over stiff-legged whenever they're shocked or startled. Goat-Toppler Maibock has startling quality and drinkability, so the name fits.  Bottom line: this latest West Des Moines Rock Bottom seasonal is not your typical maibock and is probably a better beer for it. If they all tasted like this, I'd be a massive maibock fan.\"}\n",

Perfect finish, medium-full on the bitterness.   Mouthfeel- Medium-Full Bodied, Medium Carbonation, Smooth, and has a nice alcohol warming with hops mixed in.   Overall Impression- Thanks again Mark! This is one of my favorite IPA's once again (go figure). I did enjoy it more on-tap back this summer and this may have been due to how fresh it was @ Naja's Place. Either way, get your hands on this one! Perfect grapefruit and citrus taste.\"}\n",

The nose, less bold than I'd hoped, is of caramel malt with a smattering of English-style hops (Target, Challenger, Northdown).  I enjoy the flavor, although it doesn't set my world on fire. The beer is nicely balanced between toasted malt and fruity, tea-like hops. 'Simple\", \"straightforward', and 'clean' are all words that come to mind when drinking London Pride, and I mean none of them in a negative sense.   The only reason that I prefer American IPAs/APAs to English ones is that I like the varieties of hops used in the latter and I *love* the varieties of hops used in the former. The finish is austere with a slight mineral character and the mouthfeel is smooth and soft, but doesn't even aspire to creamy.  As a gold standard for 'across the pond' pale ales, Fuller's London Pride is solid in all respects. Though, again, I prefer the American version of the style, this beer's relatively restrained use of hops allows it to be consumed in quantity without risking palate fatigue. I'm glad that it's available less than 5 minutes from my house for those (admittedly rare) cases when I don't have a U.S. hop crave goin' on.\"}\n",

Pours out to a very dark deep brown, forming a modest light tan head which quickly recedes and doesn't form any lace. The carbonation is mild, requiring a firm pour to achieve a head. The aroma is of cocoa nibs, with the piquant woody vanilla nose that nibs have, followed by slightly sour milk and more milk and a whiff of alcohol when swirled. The mouthfeel is sharp with kiwi acidity. I think this batch might be tainted because it is much more sour than anticipated for the style. I suspect a bottling sanitation issue, which unfortunately seems to be the norm from Arcadia and many other Michigan brewers. In other words, this will not age well so don't even bother. Medium bodied. Taste is a recap of the aroma. Chocolate nibs, kiwi fruit, milk, mild herbal bitterness, medium bodied, with chalky mineral adjuncts and a sour aftertaste.

I mean, we're talking about The Fixx here, and even though we all know they went home to their wives, lead singer Cy Curnin did in fact write 'Better Be Good To Me' for Tina friggin' Turner!

Visibleand sturdy carbonation, light white head that fades slowly away. Decent r.a.t.r., good mist across the top of bubbles and such. Not terribly exciting but not the usual either.  N: Strong lager strans in the nose. Wild grain, toasted grain, floral and fresh fruit (peach, pear, golden delicious apple) tones, sweet Spring. Nice.  T: Sweet brackets of honey coated grain, sweet spice, hints of pickling spice, gingerbread (a bit). Fades into more familiar thick boded lager fare, though with some white pepper notes and lingering gingerbread spice. This tastes more like a spiced beer-almost a winter warmer lager but without the thickness-than a Saison, but still an interesting variation within the style.   M: Upholding though sligyhtly hollow carbonation. Thick and juicy in its medium body, though the finish seems to stop short while the spice and yeast linger on. Slightly sour towards the very end. Ho-hum.  Notes: Not bad, but somewhat confused and schizophrenic. The spicing is a little heavy, and the hop notes are turned down quite a bit because of it or due to it. Couldn't really see myself drinking more than one of these, and that would be once in awhile. Certainly worth a try, but there are better American Saisons out there.

A moderate sweetness is favored early and is just barely overtaken by a moderate bitterness on the finish. At least the brewery didn't skimp on ingredients. Original Dark is a capable enough ale that strikes me a 'jack of all trades, master of none' sort of beer.  I'm not a bit surprised that the body/mouthfeel is middle of the road as well. It's much closer to medium than to light and doesn't make an impression either positively or a negatively. I guess that's a pretty accurate definition of the word 'average'.

Great-looking beer. S: very intense roasty and sweet-malty aroma: melted (75%-) dark chocolates, sweet coffee and roasted (wal-)nuts' roasty edge with a tarry kick, combining with a heavier, sweet malt-grist and treacles-like malty platform (with a faint trace of chicory-honey...?!); a rather perfumy-fruity hoppyness (the label says it's Goldings~~), a subtly sour dark fruitiness, and semi-sharp hop resins at the back help result in an overall 3D-structured aroma... The warming alc. sustains firmly in the background, not unexpectedly due to its abv.

Surprisingly clean finish, without undesirable syrupy or thick mouthfeel. M&D: 110%-bodied and blown with layers of flavours, but deeply in line with modern English interpretation of Russian Imperial Stout or a super-robust version of sweet Stout, not as bold and hoppy as American counterparts, nor as woody and stale as traditional English RIS. The result is utterly enjoyable though, showing a skilful-blending of black malts and good body of hops, as shown by the lingering bitterness, although a fuller performance of complexity is yet to be brought up--maybe because this bottle is still too young?

Toasted grains, chocolate, coffee, this is what a stout should smell like! Also, there's an almost indefinable 'something' in this smell. Mouthwatering.  -Taste 4.5: Toasted grains, big barley and hop tastes and lots and lots of sweet smokiness and chocolate. There is a lot of depth of flavor to this beer, but it fades away quickly after swallowing, which is somewhat unique. Swallowing leads into a delicious, bitter aftertaste which is a real thirst-quencher. I also taste more toasted grains in the aftertaste. So good.  -Mouthfeel 4.0: Good mouthfeel with an excellent amount of carbonation and 'juiciness.' This is not a beer to grab after working outside, this is one to be savored and the first drink you get of it, you will understand that. Delicious aftertaste lasts for a long time.  -Overall 4.0: The word 'reliable' is what first comes to mind. I've tasted stouts better than this, but this is the old reliable.

Something about honey beer, I'd guess.  Hazy, golden colored, big, lasting white head.  Aroma is all about the honey, big, sticky, loud and proud. Sweet, sweet. Not far from the bee.  More so in the mouth. Bam! Thick and gooey, roundly honeyed, on top of a pale lager. Probably too much honey for most, like the overdone ginger in the Zingi Beer, but there's sure something to be said for going all the way with it!  Good drinkability, if you don't mind the powerful flavor. Plenty of folks are looking for a good measure of sweetness, or are searching for some extreme expression in their brew.

A warm and comforting smell, a 'Sod the Credit Crunch\", \"Balls to the Recession' type of richness only the well off can have. This is a boardroom of the rich beer.  The taste also brings back memories of sitting round the fire and warmth. A deep malty richness and depth of the body give this beer a really good glow and feel.  The 6.5% is well hidden within the brew and even though it is a mix of two beers (Old Speckled Hen and Old 5X), the blender has got it just about perfect. This is the best GK beer I've ever had.

This tastes immediately like an over-sugared Flavor-Ice of some berry variety. Does this sugary flavor have a niche market besides kids? It wouldn't be so bad if, on the finish, an actual hint of beer came through with a husky grain flavor that actually ruined it.  M - I can't stress enough how overly carbonated this is. Crisp and sharp but sweeter than all get-out, RHR is incredibly light-bodied.

With a great 'WHOOSH!' of Arctic air I imagine to be sprinkled with the yelps of happy sled-dogs, the Frigidaire unceremoniously disgorges the vessel, bluntly refusing lodging to this brew of mutant-kind. I take the rejected single in hand... examining it carefully for dents, details of its construction, and just in case, for Poison Control Center info....  What's the can say, again? Hmmm. The ad-hoc ingredients list isn't so much a tease as it is a threat; 'Bud Light'? Ok, so that sucks, but 'natural flavors'?? I suppose that catchall category of culinary art could include those succulent notes of salt, lemon and tasty tomato, but could also include 'rust\", \"creme de camel assholes' or 'vinegar-poached louse'. I really want to know just what in the f*ck a 'Certified Color' is, too. My heart flutters timidly. 'Certified'? Like you have to have a license to use it? Like you could die if you inhaled it?

'Crack' goes the top, 'Hiss' hisses the Beast...  ...And out she slinks, a sickly fruit-drink vomitous hazy orangey-pink with a flash of soda pop bubbles. No head forms, save a thin pearly bead abandoned at the periphery of the drink. That sparkling bracelet is fed by trickle of bubbles struggling to the surface on the way to self-immolate, so eager, so driven they are to escape whatever unspeakable horror it was that kidnapped and enslaved them, once upon a time, long ago, in some faraway Frankenstein brewery deep in the darkest circles of Hell. The Cheladabeast is easily the least appetizing 'beer' I have ever gazed upon in a glass, but, in all fairness, it looks a helluva lot like pink grapefruit juice. If only it were so.  The smell is a sour whang of sour tomato and sour metal, the sour gears sourly clashing, sourish citrus lingers in the sour-ass aftersniff.   Once again I feel compelled to talk about football, and weather, too. The Jets-Bills game is on, and wow, is it sunny here! I bet my buddies up in New Yawk are deeply divided on this game... I like Buffalo, but how can I pull against Favre? What? I was reviewing this beer, oh yeah... what the Hell. I'm getting to it.  A big sip realizes the sum of all my fears all at once, bringing more salty tomatoey fishiness than I imagined possible in any beer product. Holy FUCK! Panic! This shit is AWFUL!  Worse, still, is that the advertising is true! The malt bill is metallic and no doubt that of Bud Light, as is the associated anti-hoppiness, but the real blasphemy is the bitter lemon and salted fish struggling from under sour, astringent tomato concentrate. OMFG! Is that garlic? Am I imagining how fucking horrid this is?!?! Another sip... GAH! It's real!  As the drink warms and I become accustomed to the tangy fishyness of it, it begins to grow on me a bit. Ok, so that's total bullshit. It's still so fucking awful, worse as the drink goes on, but it's become a matter of pride and perseverance now. This is my last A-B beer, after all. So I say, for now, anyway. For all the Michelobs I swilled on the golf course; for all the Natural Lights I begged off the older kids in High School; for all the nights at Bub O'Malley's in Chapel Hill I spent arm-wrestling with $2 'Bub's Cups' of my old nemesis The King... and for that old Native American dude from the Outlaw Josey Wales, I will '...endeavor to persevere.'  Awful. Drinkability relative to gravel partially dissolved in battery acid. A good brew to remember what went wrong at A-B to begin with, before the InBev bloodletting, and a perfect one to part company on. I'll still always have a soft spot in my heart for Budweiser, but the company I knew and respected is gone forever. It makes me sad to see an American icon fade into history, especially when so many people lose jobs. The King is Dead. Long live the King.\"}\n",

I've heard a lot of bold claims being made about this beer, 'best APA in Australia\", \"better than Little Creatures Pale Ale', but there really is only one way to find out for myself - the taste test.  Poured from a 330ml bottle into a tulip pint.  A: Big frothy white head is the first thing that grabs the attention. this then reduces down to a half centimeter layer of goodness. The body presents a pleasing cloudy sunset orange.  S: Damn! There are HUGE hop aromas wafting right into the pleasure centre of my brain and this is exactly what I've been missing from the last ten reviews. The hops are so powerful smelling that I'm not even detecting the malts. The aroma is a mixture of stone-fruit, pineapple and a hint of cannabis (or in the case of this beer 'cannabliss'). Now my only concern is the taste wont deliver on this mighty and promising aroma.  T: Well my fears have been alleviated in one sense; this ale tastes damn good. It's a mixture between 'S&W Pacific Ale' and 'Mac's Hop Rocker Pilsener', which can be described as stone-fruit front palate flavours followed by toasted biscuit malts and a slight resin earthy herbaceous hop bitter finish.  M: Almost as rich and creamy as a Wiessbier - carbonation is to a tee with this brew. The resin like hops make it stick to the inside of your mouth like a peanut butter beer would (perhaps there were such a thing).  D: I can totally dig this beer... HOWEVER (and here's the 'but') it is not quite as complex in flavour as the Little Creatures Pale Ale, and it's more expensive when I can get 2 pints of LCPA for $10 at my local. So my conclusion is that Murray's has done a damn fine job (as evidenced by me throwing the word 'damn' so liberally throughout my review), and whilst I could easily drink this brew day-in day-out I could do so also with LCPA... at a cheaper price. Sorry Murray's, close to toppling my favourite APA but just a little bit shy. Still a definite in my top ten Aussie beers.  Food match: Suitably something bold would go with this, like a beef Vindaloo or a Rogan Josh. Also would go well with a Thai green curry and spicy Szechuan cuisine.\"}\n",

Of course, there's no telling if this beer has any connection with Giessener brauhaus' regular range (e.g. 'Giessener Export'), or if it's an exclusively brand new beer commissioned by 'Dr. Klug'...

A: very pale straw in colour, coming with a restrained layer of white foam on top of a constantly lively carbonated body. S: biscuit+toast like lager malts along with a crisp and slightly sour hoppy edge of lemons+starfruits; clean and simple in composition, but not unpleasant or too boring thanks to the balanced, floating aroma. T: tasting just like the impression from the aroma: a softly bready/biscuity maltiness with a spritzy texture underlines a mild but very crisp mid-taste of slightly floral hoppyness, slowly yielding to a bitter hoppy aftertaste before hitting a clean finish. M&D: the mouthfeel is of decent quality of lagering, softly-carbonated and crisp, not falling too thin in the end. This is a quite balanced pale lager to quaff as a session beer, and its characteristics are akin as much to Dortmunder as to Munich Helles (frankly I don't know the difference, given such vague definitions on this site...), although I still prefer more hoppy Pilsners...

Random streaks and swirls of chunky lace stick steadfastly to the glass.  The nose is of chocolate covered hop cones and pine boughs. This is about what I expected, but it's still a treat. The sharply citric evergreen aroma is amazingly powerful, yet doesn't quite smother the roasted maltiness that identifies this as a porter. Other than restrained bittersweet chocolate, no other non-hop aromas are evident. Three Floyds and their hop obsession... gotta love 'em.  The flavor, like the nose, wields a hop cudgel and isn't afraid to swing it with force. It tastes like the brewers threw a couple of Christmas trees into the vats and let them sit for a few months. These hops are much more piney than they are citrusy; I'd be curious to know which varieties were used. Although the first several mouthfuls were almost overwhelmingly evergreen-like, I'm now able to discern the malty goodness underneath.  The first half of each mouthful is wall-to-wall hops, while the second half allows cinnamon-dusted, ground coffee bean-flecked, chocolate liqueur to strut its stuff. The malt backbone is rock solid, as it has to be to stand up to the greatest humulus lupulus assault on a porter that I've ever experienced. The mouthfeel is firmly medium with a creaminess that one usually finds only on bigger beers. If your hop tolerance is high, then this beer is as dangerously drinkable as they come.  I had a good idea what Alpha Klaus had in store before I cracked the crown, but that hasn't kept me from being impressed as hell (drinking is believing). While hops are far and away my first love, I also appreciate massively malty beer. Nothing wrong with combining the two into a two-headed beast of epic proportions. Kudos to Three Floyds for sheer audaciousness, originality and further evidence of genius. 'Christmas in a glass\", \"the best of both worlds'... whatever you call it, call it great beer.\"}\n",

The mouthfeel is full and round- satisfying without being sticky or cloying. It finishes with just a wee aftertaste- not at all distracting.

Poured from a 500ml bottle into a conical pint.  A: This ale presents itself with a clear tawny body and a light eggshell head that dissipates to a thin lacing.  S: As advertised this brew smells very much like banana bread - they got that right at least (I'm talking about you Bickie beer!). There is nothing that really distinguishes the aroma as anything but banana bread; hops are in there somewhere but the focus is set on the bready banana smell quite explicitly... good I say - I like it when a product does what it's advertised to do.  T: Less banana and more hops than I was expecting. The flavours very much hop-centric bitterness without a strong malt base to quell it, and the banana I believe as a result of this has taken a backseat. Perhaps Wells should have followed the example set by German Weissbier brewers? I've definitely had more banana flavours in a Weiss, and if you're making a banana bread beer the message you want to send to the drinker is 'Taste this! Banana bread!', instead the both of these tastes are fairly muted, oh well... the aftertaste is very banana orientated though... odd.  M: Low to mid body & carbonation as expected from an English ale.  D: Disappointed in a way; this beer smells great however the flavour profile is too much hop bitters and not enough malt, yeast & banana is coming through. It seems like a waste of a brilliant idea and if you're looking for banana flavours in a beer you're better off drinking a Weissbier... seriously. Still it is almost as drinkable as a classic English bitter, but there is a list as long as my arm of ales that would make a better option than this.

Month/week label notches at 'N\", \"2' and '5', for what that's worth; it's been cellared at least 2 years is all I know. Of note, the label shows an ABV of 'only' 10%, so this has increased a good bit in recent vintages.  A: Deep chestnut auburn, ruby-tinted and fiery warmth - mesmerizing color. Many fine wriggling and edge-creeping carbonation streams rise to a thin almond head. Good retention and specks and stripes of lace linger then droop after each sip.  S: Sweet toffee and buttery nuts, like a candied reduction over pralines. Vanilla subtleties and cocoa spikes, indistinct boozy fruit (a mild apple/pear brandy?). Not incredibly strong, just deep, complex and completely inviting.  T: Brown sugar, raisin, toffee and buttercream... it all sounds too sweet, but magically this suspends belief with deftly balanced hop spicing and bittering. A little ashy wood in the finish and some drier cocoa powder. Recognizing that the style isn't very hop-forward, the way that this has held and evolved over the years is pretty spectacular.  M: Absolutely the smoothest mouthfeel I've ever experienced in a barleywine - soft and slightly syrupy (think a velvety maple - the good stuff). Refined and pliable, yet filling out and coating stealthily.   D: Just a damn stunning barleywine; I find it really hard to give a 'perfect 5' to any strong beer in this category, but this one is sooo very close. I've enjoyed it much fresher (a year or less since bottling), but with 3-4 years of age, Arctic Devil absolutely glows. As of now, perhaps my favorite of the style.\"}\n",

The head grows thick, just like most stouts, foamy, and has a brown chocolaty color to it. It fizzes out quit quickly, leaves film on the surface of the beer after many, many gulps and when you tip the glass the remnants of the head move in a viscous manner with the dark liquid. She definitely looks yummy.  What I get most from this is a smell of raisins that's mixed with coffee. Sweet and roasted malts make their way in there as well as a sweet lactose. It's not as 'dark' as most other stouts but it's a sweet stout so I understand that.  I definitely recommend drinking this at a warmer temperature, like most any stout. When it was cold and I drank it, it had little body to it and tasted only bitter. After letting it sit for awhile it's true character came out. It's still bitter from hops, the raisin, and coffee but it is also very sweet from the lactose. It's the bittersweet, as the description on the bottle says, flavor that best describes this stout. It does have a creaminess to it and the end tastes a bit grainy.  It has a medium body to it that is more porter-like than I'd expect from a stout. I wish this had a 'fuller\", \"darker' flavor and body to it. I'm sorry, but I prefer my stouts to be thick and hearty. The middle is missing in my opinion. I'd say it has a creamy feel to it.  This is definitely very drinkable. I think the bitterness might put off some but the medium body means it's easy to get down.\"}\n",

I have no real complaints about the beer, as it is pleasant tasting, but these days it just seems a little weak, packing just 4.5% abv. It actually reminds me of a few porters I've tasted rather than stouts.  In fact it's quite quaint that in England, where most pints in the pub would be coming in at about 3.8% abv, that this pint would be considered premium strength, and at least in the area where I came from, you would be considered 'a bit of a nutter\", \"on the strong stuff' or 'looking for a wild time' were you to stick with this beer for the full session.  Ahhh..memories..\"}\n",

I have been very lax since the beginning of the school year and I am hoping to get a) either off of that merry-go-'round or b) catch my breath and drink some beer. Tonight is more of the latter than the former. I scored the glass/CAN combo at The Fridge last weekend but I did not have a chance to drink the beer so here goes ...  From the (big-ass) CAN: ' The long tradition of the Munich Oktoberfest began in 1810 on the occasion of the marriage of Crown Prince Ludwig von Bayern and Princess Therese von Sachsen-Hildburghausen, to which the Munich population was also invited. Munich's residents lovingly call the area on which the world's largest folk festival has traditionally taken place since then the 'Wiesn' (meadow). You [CAN] also participate in our festival this year again, since we are bringing the Oktoberfest feeling into your home. Celebrate with us and enjoy drinking a 'Oktoberfest Wiesn' specialty out of an original 'Wiesn' beer mug. Paulaner Oktoberfest Wiesn Bier is brewed strictly according to the Bavarian beer purity law of 1516 only from the best natural ingredients. It has the character of a typically bottom-fermented festival brew - a deep golden yellow color, with a balanced harmonious taste and the pleasant fragrance of hops. A full-bodied, wonderfully mellow Wiesn Ale [?] enjoyment.'  I am sooo stoked to get the Crack & Glug going on this one! Just as Van Halen sang in 'Everybody Wants Some!!\", \"... I like the little way the line runs up the back of the stockings', I like the way the seam runs up the CAN on the side. It is very evocative of the old steel CANs with the pop top. Now, I want some, too! So much so that I even paid for it, WTF?!?  The pour created no less than three (!) fingers of dense, bone-white head with excellent retention. I was impressed, which is unusual given my jaded persona. Color was a deep golden-yellow with NE-quality clarity. Greg Koch CAN hate fizzy yellow beers all he wants, but this was my idea of epic! Nose was very sweet and grainy, cereal-like in its intensity. Not adjunct-driven, but a cereal-like semi-sweetness not generally found in an Oktoberfest. Prosit! Mouthfeel was medium and it was much less sweet in the mouth than the nose led me to expect. It had a medium body with a decent, but not overpowering, amount of carbonation. The sweetness of the style was there, but it was not cloying as some examples have been of late. We had the Lancaster Liederkranz Choir at Iron Hill today and I felt badly - I know all of the words, but in English, not German! Grummy Fryberger nee Chandler would be disappointed. Not disappointing, however, was this beer. The finish was semi-dry, which is about how I CAN tolerate the style. I really hate cloying, syrupy Oktoberfests (do you hear me, Sam. Adams?), but this was decent. Plus, I got a new big azzz glass in the deal. I love beer from a CAN - it makes me wistful and nostalgic.  Ach du lieber! I also intended to recount the tale of Erik M., a fellow student with whom I grew up. For his graduation present, his parents sent him to Munich for Oktoberfest and despite all of our underage drinking, he came home amazed at what he had encountered. 'Little girls were drinking me under the table and I could barely lift my glass!' he told us. I snickered in my status as a seagoing sailor, but in my age, I know where he was coming from.\"}\n",

As always, I will try to comment here away from what has gone previously. My ranking or specific commentary is worthless to pros. I am but a novice. I know what I like. I like quads, strong dark ales with complexity and flavor.   As I pour it into a goblet, I notice the lack of head, and an unassuming semi translucent mahogany hue.  The bottle is colder than I like to drink. But my pattern is to start chilled and let it come up to room temp before I start seriously sipping.   Aroma is very subdued, Earthy, but not heady - not revealing too much of what's to come.  What comes is nothing short of history in a bottle. The mystery and intrigue of centuries of Trappist Monks creating the ultimate ale is present in every sip.   Once again I am forced to reference legend. If there was ever a beer that could eclipse the stories of Mead, Treacle, Butter Beer or Ambrosia - this truly is a magical nectar in our physical mundane, Muggle world. The words 'flagon\", \"quaff' and 'tavern' were created to accessorize this ale.   I can't imagine what standardization needs to be in place to vote something the 'best beer in the world'. It seems like a ludicrously subjective classification. And as amazing as this beer is - I'm not saying that I'd choose it every or all night. But really -there is no 'next best contender' to this beer, because it is unique in its approach and scope. A heady breath of dark, slightly figgy, mildly sweet (and I mean mild) malt flavors hits the tongue and then dissipates into... more of the same. Instead of transmuting into some phenol-ridden, frothy fluff - the flavor just exponentially increases and drapes as it travels over your palette.   As I get to the bottom of the bottle, the cloudy sediment shows its presence. Flavors are hard to isolate because the blend has been perfected into a cohesive whole ONEness. But some fig, currant and - as God is my witness - LOAM come to the top of the pile.   The hype is high on this one because of its legendary rareness. One in a while hype is justified. Sometimes, you just need to recognize that the laws of supply and demand are affected by real world lay-lines of taste and appreciation.  There are so many magical fables that we can't reach out and touch. If, as a child - you ever longed for Brigadoon, Narnia, Middle Earth or Neverland to be real - go through the motions and acquire a bottle of this beer. It's worth the trouble to reaffirm your sense of humility and wonder in the world.\"}\n",

The taste is rich and my nose must be broken, because the hint of smoke I spoke of was one hell of an understatement, the lightly acrid, earthy aroma proving actual in flavor, not imagined, with tons of medium-dark malts and sticky caramel layered on top. The barest hint of fruity, apple-like sweetness splashes in and out, as does muddy peat and a clean, charcoal-like bitterness. Nowhere is the substantial alcohol evident.

The strength of the aroma surprised me when I opened the bottle: a somewhat wine like odor typical of British style ales.  The initial taste is a buttery, malty taste with a slight wine flavor aftertaste. For a summer ale, this one has a surprisingly complex taste profile. In the mouthfeel and aftertaste, this ale reminds me of Fuller's summer ale I had in a bottle years ago. The hops give this one a crispness and very subtle bitterness to balance everything.  Decent carbonation gives you a slight burn on the back of the throat as well as a slick feeling on the tongue.  This would be a fine session ale for any season.

Its surface, about as bald as an eggshell, doesn't do much to help dismiss the notion. Its clarity and frolic bubbles notwithstanding, I'm not getting a great vibe from the look of things.   Gueuzes are normally searingly high in acid, with an intensely tart fruitiness and aromas described by many as 'barnyard\", \"hay' and 'horse blanket'. They are, to say the least, distinctive. This one raises flags, however. It admits an obvious sugar addition and whatever little sourness can be noted seems forged and prefabricated.   You'd have to be missing taste buds to find this even the slightest bit palatable. It is an intensely corny flavour, terribly lacking in fruit. Synthetic honey and artificial sweetener factor in way too highly for a beverage that is, by distinction, tart and acidic. This is like a pop that started out as corn syrup and never had any artificial flavouring added.   There's not enough sugar to warrant a call to the diabetes hotline but this is definitely way, way sweeter than it is sour or acidic. My guess is that whatever hands were responsible for its creation also made sure the beer was sterilized and filtered so as to eliminate any and all of the good microbiota that gives the beer its distinguishing features.   It chafes the palate with such friction, it's like an unshaven woman is rubbing her stubby legs across my tongue. It is a pointy sensation that completely deflates in the aftertaste; the flavours finish with the sharp abruptness of rotten seafood. It leaves the tongue saturated in raw sugar and something eerily reminiscent of corn syrup.   I rarely feel that the final score I rate a beer provides fair or adequate insight to its craftsmanship, its character or, much less even, my enjoyment of it. In this case, however, I assure you, the final grade you see should be considered generous, take it as a warning sign. The beer is a blatant forgery, a sorry mess of prefabrication and kitsch.   Gueuze is a bit of an acquired taste; bad gueuze, such as this, goes far beyond that. Counterfeits like St Louis Gueuze prove that brewing is not a medium in which one can lie successfully. Industry and machines are no substitute for human touch and the sum of hundreds of years of tried and tested development, nurturing and tradition.\"}\n",

The alcohol nose isn't overbearing but blended across a spectrum of fruity yet musty tones of paradise, this beer has to be one of the most enticing aromatic creations ever to come across my path. Taste: Even as it warms the sharp wheat based malt sweetness mixed perfectly with the alcoholic tone fruits such as pear, banana, and mild apple tones over a brown sugar base arise and soar over the palate oh 'come a little bit closer hear what I have to say\", \"just like children sleeping we could dream this night away\", \"but there's a full moon rising, let's go dancing in the light'. Wow, this is an experience whoever samples this beer must pop in some Neil Young it's awesome together. Mouthfeel: Slight sense of chiunkiness to it medium to full bodied luscious wheat ale, a must try for all German style beer lovers, props go out to Bill and Ron on this one muchas gracias guys for creating not just a sessionn of exotic ale sipping, but one that will be emblazoned in my memory as one of the most skillfully constructed good times I have shared with true art. Drinkability: Well, I don't even know what the ABV of this beer is but I can tell you that after one I am feeling on another level of relaxation and at peace with the world. We all need that push to get us through the day, and to picture an evening with my own family someday and a night cap in the form of a Moonglow each day will be more blissful than the next.\"}\n",

Geeks...shut the hell up.  That being said, Storm king is.... pretty....damn...good.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle jet black with a small filthy looking tan head. On the nose was all of your usual suspects - coffee, molasses, figs and raisins and a some nice herbal hop aroma. Lots of nice fruit as well. Taste was very rich, creamy and mouth-filling. Quite heavy dark malt, pumpernickel bread, tons of ale fruit esters, moderate roasted flavor and a huge kick of burnt brown sugar. Keeping all of this monster malt sweetness under control was a healthy dose of hop bitterness that really cut the malt sweetness perfectly, creating a very balanced imperial stout. At almost 10% alcohol, this boy was still very drinkable and smooth. Victory shows time and again why they are considered a top 5 craft brewery. Awesome stuff.\"}\n",

Oh, and readily 'available' too.   Though this is a bit plain for long-term consideration.   It is all brown sugar and caramel nougat. Raisiny too. Green and brown.  The yeast traits give this a bit of funk (which is not something I tend to look for in a mate). Quasi-Belgianesque peppery fruit. Though much more clean and narrow.

Even after a rather vigorous pour, I was barely able to coax a 2 finger head, which promptly fell to a nice film on the surface in the time it took me to walk from my kitchen to my computer upstairs.  S: Really not much to write home about. Granted, I don't have the best nose, I still didn't get much. I got some wonderful roasty malts, a little coffee, and just the barest hints of hops... I might even be imagining it.  T: This is where it's all at!!! Right off there's a creaminess that is reminiscent of an oatmeal stout, deep, rich chocolaty flavors, coffee notes, a burnt/ smoky flavor that actually adds a lot to the taste, and some caramel/ brown sugar like sweetness   M: wonderfully thick, not for those turned off by dark, thick, viscous beers. carbonation starts off a hair prickly, right on the border of being too much. Then it slowly fades and gradually reveals the many layers of flavor. leaves a rather sticky coating that is really sweet.  D: Very drinkable, goes down really easy. at 8% it's about twice what you would call a session beer.... so if this WERE to be your session beer, you session would end very, very fast.  O: Friggin Scot's and their 'Wee heavy\", \"wee' heavy my ass... this thing packs a punch that you won't feel till its too late if you're not careful (which I wasn't). My father is not one to mooch and for the most part, is indifferent to most of the beers that I get, but, as of the completion of this review (about 30 Min.), has sucked down half of my sixer!

Lace is left on most of the glass.  S - Very sweet malty caramel and vanilla opens the aroma up with an odd scent. A little toffee and English muffin comes out too. English hops are incredibly mild in the aroma and unfitting, especially with the tag line on the neck band. Too malt-driven and too sweet in aroma for a summer beer.  T - The sweetness in the aroma is mostly balanced out in flavor as the English hops pull through more. The vanilla remains on the finish but a slightly buttery aspect enters the picture. It seems a little off.  M - Borderline crisp and very smooth, Summer Ale has a tiny bitter hint on the finish overshadowed by vanilla. Lower carbonation feel on the swallow too.  D - Easy enough to drink I suppose but slight hints of off flavors aren't encouraging. The vanilla seems pretty out-of-place and neither the hops nor the bitterness is large enough here.\"}\n",

       "'\\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by humans or by other animals. Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.\\nAI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).[1]\\nAs machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require \"intelligence\" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[2] For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.[3]\\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since it has experienced several waves of optimism,[4][5] followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an \"AI winter\"),[6][7] followed by new approaches, success, and renewed funding.[5][8] AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge, and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical and statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.[8][9]\\nThe various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects.[a] General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field\\'s long-term goals.[10] To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability, and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.\\nThe field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence \"can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\".[b] This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction (science fiction), and philosophy since antiquity.[12] Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards goals beneficial to humankind.[c] The term artificial intelligence has also been criticized for overhyping AI\\'s true technological capabilities.[13][14][15]\\nArtificial beings with intelligence appeared as storytelling devices in antiquity,[16] and have been common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein or Karel Čapek\\'s R.U.R.[17] These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence.[18]\\nThe study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing\\'s theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction. This insight that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning is known as the Church–Turing thesis.[19] This, along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology, information theory and cybernetics, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain.[20] The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts\\' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete \"artificial neurons\".[21]\\nBy the 1950s, two visions for how to achieve machine intelligence emerged. One vision, known as Symbolic AI or GOFAI, was to use computers to create a symbolic representation of the world and systems that could reason about the world. Proponents included Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, and Marvin Minsky. Closely associated with this approach was the \"heuristic search\" approach, which likened intelligence to a problem of exploring a space of possibilities for answers.\\nThe second vision, known as the connectionist approach, sought to achieve intelligence through learning. Proponents of this approach, most prominently Frank Rosenblatt, sought to connect Perceptron in ways inspired by connections of neurons.[22] James Manyika and others have compared the two approaches to the mind (Symbolic AI) and the brain (connectionist). Manyika argues that symbolic approaches dominated the push for artificial intelligence in this period, due in part to its connection to intellectual traditions of Descartes, Boole, Gottlob Frege, Bertrand Russell, and others. Connectionist approaches based on cybernetics or artificial neural networks were pushed to the background but have gained new prominence in recent decades.[23]\\nThe field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.[d][26] The attendees became the founders and leaders of AI research.[e] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\":[f] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.[g][28]\\nBy the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense[29] and laboratories had been established around the world.[30]\\nResearchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would eventually succeed in creating a machine with artificial general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field.[31] Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\".[32] Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, \"within a generation\\xa0... the problem of creating \\'artificial intelligence\\' will substantially be solved\".[33]\\nThey had failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks. Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill[34] and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI. The next few years would later be called an \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult.[6]\\nIn the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[35] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan\\'s fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[5] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[7]\\nMany researchers began to doubt that the symbolic approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition. A number of researchers began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches to specific AI problems.[36] Robotics researchers, such as Rodney Brooks, rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic engineering problems that would allow robots to move, survive, and learn their environment.[h]\\nInterest in neural networks and \"connectionism\" was revived by Geoffrey Hinton, David Rumelhart and others in the middle of the 1980s.[41] Soft computing tools were developed in the 1980s, such as neural networks, fuzzy systems, Grey system theory, evolutionary computation and many tools drawn from statistics or mathematical optimization.\\nAI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by finding specific solutions to specific problems. The narrow focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results, exploit more mathematical methods, and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics).[42] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\".[9]\\nFaster computers, algorithmic improvements and access to large amounts of data enabled advances in machine learning and perception; data-hungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks around 2012.[43] According to Bloomberg\\'s Jack Clark, 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software projects that use AI within Google increased from a \"sporadic usage\" in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects.[i] He attributed this to an increase in affordable neural networks, due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets.[8]\\nIn a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported they had \"incorporated AI in some offerings or processes\".[44] The amount of research into AI (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.[45]\\nNumerous academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing the original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Much of current research involves statistical AI, which is overwhelmingly used to solve specific problems, even highly successful techniques such as deep learning. This concern has led to the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.[10]\\nIn April 2023, computer scientist Jaron Lanier published an alternative view of AI in The New Yorker as less intelligent than the name, and popular culture, may suggest. Lanier concludes his essay as follows: \"Think of people. People are the answer to the problems of bits.\"[46][47]\\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.[a]\\nEarly researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[48] By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had developed methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.[49]\\nMany of these algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a \"combinatorial explosion\": they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger.[50] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[51]\\nKnowledge representation and knowledge engineering[52] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts.\\nA representation of \"what exists\" is an ontology: the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them.[53] The most general ontologies are called upper ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge and act as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). A truly intelligent program would also need access to commonsense knowledge; the set of facts that an average person knows. The semantics of an ontology is typically represented in description logic, such as the Web Ontology Language.[54]\\nAI research has developed tools to represent specific domains, such as objects, properties, categories and relations between objects;[54] situations, events, states and time;[55] causes and effects;[56] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);.[57] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);[58] as well as other domains. Among the most difficult problems in AI are: the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the number of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[59] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally).[51]\\nFormal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[60] scene interpretation,[61] clinical decision support,[62] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases),[63] and other areas.[64]\\nMachine learning (ML), a fundamental concept of AI research since the field\\'s inception,[j] is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.[k]\\nUnsupervised learning finds patterns in a stream of input.\\nSupervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification and numerical regression. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in – the program sees a number of examples of things from several categories and will learn to classify new inputs. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should change as the inputs change. Both classifiers and regression learners can be viewed as \"function approximators\" trying to learn an unknown (possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two categories, \"spam\" or \"not spam\".[68]\\nIn reinforcement learning the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent classifies its responses to form a strategy for operating in its problem space.[69]\\nTransfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[70]\\nComputational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[71]\\nNatural language processing (NLP)[72]\\nallows machines to read and understand human language. A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural-language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications of NLP include information retrieval, question answering and machine translation.[73]\\nSymbolic AI used formal syntax to translate the deep structure of sentences into logic. This failed to produce useful applications, due to the intractability of logic[50] and the breadth of commonsense knowledge.[59] Modern statistical techniques include co-occurrence frequencies (how often one word appears near another), \"Keyword spotting\" (searching for a particular word to retrieve information), transformer-based deep learning (which finds patterns in text), and others.[74] They have achieved acceptable accuracy at the page or paragraph level, and, by 2019, could generate coherent text.[75]Machine perception[76]\\nis the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, and active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Applications include speech recognition,[77]\\nfacial recognition, and object recognition.[78]\\nComputer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.[79]\\nAffective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process or simulate human feeling, emotion and mood.[81]\\nFor example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.\\nHowever, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of how intelligent existing computer agents actually are.[82] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis), wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.[83]\\nA machine with general intelligence can solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence. There are several competing ideas about how to develop artificial general intelligence. Hans Moravec and Marvin Minsky argue that work in different individual domains can be incorporated into an advanced multi-agent system or cognitive architecture with general intelligence.[84]\\nPedro Domingos hopes that there is a conceptually straightforward, but mathematically difficult, \"master algorithm\" that could lead to AGI.[85]\\nOthers believe that anthropomorphic features like an artificial brain[86]\\nor simulated child development[l]\\nwill someday reach a critical point where general intelligence emerges.\\nAI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.[87] Reasoning can be reduced to performing a search. For example, logical proof can be viewed as searching for a path that leads from premises to conclusions, where each step is the application of an inference rule.[88] Planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.[89] Robotics algorithms for moving limbs and grasping objects use local searches in configuration space.[90]\\nSimple exhaustive searches[91]\\nare rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes. The solution, for many problems, is to use \"heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" that prioritize choices in favor of those more likely to reach a goal and to do so in a shorter number of steps. In some search methodologies, heuristics can also serve to eliminate some choices unlikely to lead to a goal (called \"pruning the search tree\"). Heuristics supply the program with a \"best guess\" for the path on which the solution lies.[92]\\nHeuristics limit the search for solutions into a smaller sample size.[93]\\nA very different kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, until we reach the top. Other related optimization algorithms include random optimization, beam search and metaheuristics like simulated annealing.[94] Evolutionary computation uses a form of optimization search. For example, they may begin with a population of organisms (the guesses) and then allow them to mutate and recombine, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation (refining the guesses). Classic evolutionary algorithms include genetic algorithms, gene expression programming, and genetic programming.[95] Alternatively, distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).[96]\\nLogic[97]\\nis used for knowledge representation and problem-solving, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning[98]\\nand inductive logic programming is a method for learning.[99]\\nSeveral different forms of logic are used in AI research. Propositional logic[100] involves truth functions such as \"or\" and \"not\". First-order logic[101]\\nadds quantifiers and predicates and can express facts about objects, their properties, and their relations with each other. Fuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" (between 0 and 1) to vague statements such as \"Alice is old\" (or rich, or tall, or hungry), that are too linguistically imprecise to be completely true or false.[102]\\nDefault logics, non-monotonic logics and circumscription are forms of logic designed to help with default reasoning and the qualification problem.[58]\\nSeveral extensions of logic have been designed to handle specific domains of knowledge, such as description logics;[54]\\nsituation calculus, event calculus and fluent calculus (for representing events and time);[55]\\ncausal calculus;[56]\\nbelief calculus (belief revision); and modal logics.[57]\\nLogics to model contradictory or inconsistent statements arising in multi-agent systems have also been designed, such as paraconsistent logics.[103]\\nMany problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[104]\\nBayesian networks[105]\\nare a very general tool that can be used for various problems, including reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),[m][107]\\nlearning (using the expectation-maximization algorithm),[n][109]\\nplanning (using decision networks)[110] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[111]\\nProbabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing and finding explanations for streams of data, helping perception systems to analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).[111]\\nA key concept from the science of economics is \"utility\", a measure of how valuable something is to an intelligent agent. Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,[112]\\nand information value theory.[113] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes,[114] dynamic decision networks,[111] game theory and mechanism design.[115]\\nThe simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (\"if shiny then diamond\") and controllers (\"if diamond then pick up\"). Controllers do, however, also classify conditions before inferring actions, and therefore classification forms a central part of many AI systems. Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be tuned according to examples, making them very attractive for use in AI. These examples are known as observations or patterns. In supervised learning, each pattern belongs to a certain predefined class. A class is a decision that has to be made. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.[116]\\nA classifier can be trained in various ways; there are many statistical and machine learning approaches.\\nThe decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.[117]\\nK-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s.[118]\\nKernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.[119]\\nThe naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\"[120] at Google, due in part to its scalability.[121]\\nNeural networks are also used for classification.[122]\\nClassifier performance depends greatly on the characteristics of the data to be classified, such as the dataset size, distribution of samples across classes, dimensionality, and the level of noise. Model-based classifiers perform well if the assumed model is an extremely good fit for the actual data. Otherwise, if no matching model is available, and if accuracy (rather than speed or scalability) is the sole concern, conventional wisdom is that discriminative classifiers (especially SVM) tend to be more accurate than model-based classifiers such as \"naive Bayes\" on most practical data sets.[123]\\nNeural networks[122]\\nwere inspired by the architecture of neurons in the human brain. A simple \"neuron\" N accepts input from other neurons, each of which, when activated (or \"fired\"), casts a weighted \"vote\" for or against whether neuron N should itself activate. Learning requires an algorithm to adjust these weights based on the training data; one simple algorithm (dubbed \"fire together, wire together\") is to increase the weight between two connected neurons when the activation of one triggers the successful activation of another. Neurons have a continuous spectrum of activation; in addition, neurons can process inputs in a nonlinear way rather than weighing straightforward votes.\\nModern neural networks model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. They can learn continuous functions and even digital logical operations. Neural networks can be viewed as a type of mathematical optimization – they perform gradient descent on a multi-dimensional topology that was created by training the network. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.[124]\\nOther learning techniques for neural networks are Hebbian learning (\"fire together, wire together\"), GMDH or competitive learning.[125]\\nThe main categories of networks are acyclic or feedforward neural networks (where the signal passes in only one direction) and recurrent neural networks (which allow feedback and short-term memories of previous input events). Among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons and radial basis networks.[126]\\nDeep learning[128]\\nuses several layers of neurons between the network\\'s inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits or letters or faces.[129] Deep learning has drastically improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, image classification[130] and others.\\nDeep learning often uses convolutional neural networks for many or all of its layers. In a convolutional layer, each neuron receives input from only a restricted area of the previous layer called the neuron\\'s receptive field. This can substantially reduce the number of weighted connections between neurons,[131] and creates a hierarchy similar to the organization of the animal visual cortex.[132]\\nIn a recurrent neural network (RNN) the signal will propagate through a layer more than once;[133]\\nthus, an RNN is an example of deep learning.[134]\\nRNNs can be trained by gradient descent,[135]\\nhowever long-term gradients which are back-propagated can \"vanish\" (that is, they can tend to zero) or \"explode\" (that is, they can tend to infinity), known as the vanishing gradient problem.[136]\\nThe long short term memory (LSTM) technique can prevent this in most cases.[137]\\nSpecialized languages for artificial intelligence have been developed, such as Lisp, Prolog, TensorFlow and many others. Hardware developed for AI includes AI accelerators and neuromorphic computing.\\nAI is relevant to any intellectual task.[138]\\nModern artificial intelligence techniques are pervasive and are too numerous to list here.[139]\\nFrequently, when a technique reaches mainstream use, it is no longer considered artificial intelligence; this phenomenon is described as the AI effect.[140]\\nIn the 2010s, AI applications were at the heart of the most commercially successful areas of computing, and have become a ubiquitous feature of daily life. AI is used in search engines (such as Google Search),\\ntargeting online advertisements,[141] recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon),\\ndriving internet traffic,[142][143] targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook),\\nvirtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa),[144] autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars),\\nautomatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate),\\nfacial recognition (Apple\\'s Face ID or Microsoft\\'s DeepFace),\\nimage labeling (used by Facebook, Apple\\'s iPhoto and TikTok)\\n, spam filtering and chatbots (such as Chat GPT).\\nThere are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve problems for specific industries or institutions. A few examples are energy storage,[145] deepfakes,[146] medical diagnosis, military logistics, foreign policy,[147] or supply chain management.\\nGame playing has been a test of AI\\'s strength since the 1950s. Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[148] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM\\'s question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[149]\\nIn March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps.[150] Other programs handle imperfect-information games; such as for poker at a superhuman level, Pluribus[o] and Cepheus.[152] DeepMind in the 2010s developed a \"generalized artificial intelligence\" that could learn many diverse Atari games on its own.[153]\\nBy 2020, Natural Language Processing systems such as the enormous GPT-3 (then by far the largest artificial neural network) were matching human performance on pre-existing benchmarks, albeit without the system attaining a commonsense understanding of the contents of the benchmarks.[154]\\nDeepMind\\'s AlphaFold 2 (2020) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein.[155]\\nOther applications predict the result of judicial decisions,[156] create art (such as poetry or painting) and prove mathematical theorems.\\nAI content detector tools are software applications that use artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to analyze and detect specific types of content in digital media, such as text, images, and videos. These tools are commonly used to identify inappropriate content, such as speech errors, violent or sexual images, and spam, among others.\\nSome benefits of using AI content detector tools[157] include improved efficiency and accuracy in detecting inappropriate content, increased safety and security for users, and reduced legal and reputational risks for websites and platforms.\\nSmart traffic lights have been developed at Carnegie Mellon since 2009. Professor Stephen Smith has started a company since then Surtrac that has installed smart traffic control systems in 22 cities. It costs about $20,000 per intersection to install. Drive time has been reduced by 25% and traffic jam waiting time has been reduced by 40% at the intersections it has been installed.[158]\\nIn 2019, WIPO reported that AI was the most prolific emerging technology in terms of the number of patent applications and granted patents, the Internet of things was estimated to be the largest in terms of market size. It was followed, again in market size, by big data technologies, robotics, AI, 3D printing and the fifth generation of mobile services (5G).[159] Since AI emerged in the 1950s, 340,000 AI-related patent applications were filed by innovators and 1.6 million scientific papers have been published by researchers, with the majority of all AI-related patent filings published since 2013. Companies represent 26 out of the top 30 AI patent applicants, with universities or public research organizations accounting for the remaining four.[160] The ratio of scientific papers to inventions has significantly decreased from 8:1 in 2010 to 3:1 in 2016, which is attributed to be indicative of a shift from theoretical research to the use of AI technologies in commercial products and services. Machine learning is the dominant AI technique disclosed in patents and is included in more than one-third of all identified inventions (134,777 machine learning patents filed for a total of 167,038 AI patents filed in 2016), with computer vision being the most popular functional application. AI-related patents not only disclose AI techniques and applications, they often also refer to an application field or industry. Twenty application fields were identified in 2016 and included, in order of magnitude: telecommunications (15 percent), transportation (15 percent), life and medical sciences (12 percent), and personal devices, computing and human–computer interaction (11 percent). Other sectors included banking, entertainment, security, industry and manufacturing, agriculture, and networks (including social networks, smart cities and the Internet of things). IBM has the largest portfolio of AI patents with 8,290 patent applications, followed by Microsoft with 5,930 patent applications.[160]\\nAlan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question \\'can machines think\\'?\"[161]\\nHe advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\".[161]\\nHe devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.[162] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people[p] but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks\"[163]\\nRussell and Norvig agree with Turing that AI must be defined in terms of \"acting\" and not \"thinking\".[164] However, they are critical that the test compares machines to people. \"Aeronautical engineering texts,\" they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making \\'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.\\'\"[165] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".[166]\\nMcCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world.\"[167] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky similarly defines it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\".[168] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.\\nA definition that has also been adopted by Google[169][better\\xa0source\\xa0needed] – major practitionary in the field of AI.\\nThis definition stipulated the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.\\nNo established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history.[q] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, neat, soft and narrow (see below). Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.\\nSymbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\")[171] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"[172]\\nHowever, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec\\'s paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult.[173]\\nPhilosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.[174]\\nAlthough his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree.[r][51]\\nThe issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,[176][177] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.\\n\"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems (especially in areas like common sense reasoning). This issue was actively discussed in the 70s and 80s,[178]\\nbut in the 1990s mathematical methods and solid scientific standards became the norm, a transition that Russell and Norvig termed \"the victory of the neats\".[179]\\nFinding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems.[50] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 80s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.\\nAI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence (general AI) directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field\\'s long-term goals.[180][181]\\nGeneral intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The experimental sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.\\nThe philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field. Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig observe that most AI researchers \"don\\'t care about the [philosophy of AI] – as long as the program works, they don\\'t care whether you call it a simulation of intelligence or real intelligence.\"[182] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.\\nDavid Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.[183] The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all. Human information processing is easy to explain, however, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.[184]\\nComputationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind-body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.[185]\\nPhilosopher John Searle characterized this position as \"strong AI\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"[s]\\nSearle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that, even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior, there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind.[188]\\nIf a machine has a mind and subjective experience, then it may also have sentience (the ability to feel), and if so, then it could also suffer, and thus it would be entitled to certain rights.[189]\\nAny hypothetical robot rights would lie on a spectrum with animal rights and human rights.[190]\\nThis issue has been considered in fiction for centuries,[191]\\nand is now being considered by, for example, California\\'s Institute for the Future; however, critics argue that the discussion is premature.[192]\\nA superintelligence, hyperintelligence, or superhuman intelligence, is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind. Superintelligence may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent.[181]\\nIf research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to recursive self-improvement.[193]\\nIts intelligence would increase exponentially in an intelligence explosion and could dramatically surpass humans. Science fiction writer Vernor Vinge named this scenario the \"singularity\".[194]\\nBecause it is difficult or impossible to know the limits of intelligence or the capabilities of superintelligent machines, the technological singularity is an occurrence beyond which events are unpredictable or even unfathomable.[195]\\nRobot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick, and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines will merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.[196]\\nEdward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next stage in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler\\'s \"Darwin among the Machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his book of the same name in 1998.[197]\\nIn the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we\\'re in uncharted territory\" with AI.[198]\\nA survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed.[199]\\nSubjective estimates of the risk vary widely; for example, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimate 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classifies only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\".[t][201]\\nUnlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist states that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\".[202]\\nJobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.[203]\\nAI provides a number of tools that are particularly useful for authoritarian governments: smart spyware, face recognition and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance; such surveillance allows machine learning to classify potential enemies of the state and can prevent them from hiding; recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect; deepfakes aid in producing misinformation; advanced AI can make centralized decision making more competitive with liberal and decentralized systems such as markets.[204]\\nTerrorists, criminals and rogue states may use other forms of weaponized AI such as advanced digital warfare and lethal autonomous weapons. By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.[205]\\nMachine-learning AI is also able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.[206]\\nAI programs can become biased after learning from real-world data. It is not typically introduced by the system designers but is learned by the program, and thus the programmers are often unaware that the bias exists.[207]\\nBias can be inadvertently introduced by the way training data is selected.[208]\\nIt can also emerge from correlations: AI is used to classify individuals into groups and then make predictions assuming that the individual will resemble other members of the group. In some cases, this assumption may be unfair.[209] An example of this is COMPAS, a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. ProPublica claims that the COMPAS-assigned recidivism risk level of black defendants is far more likely to be overestimated than that of white defendants, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants.[210]\\nHealth equity issues may also be exacerbated when many-to-many mapping are done without taking steps to ensure equity for populations at risk for bias. At this time equity-focused tools and regulations are not in place to ensure equity application representation and usage.[211] Other examples where algorithmic bias can lead to unfair outcomes are when AI is used for credit rating or hiring.\\nAt its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022) the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings recommending that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.[212]\\nSuperintelligent AI may be able to improve itself to the point that humans could not control it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking puts it, \"spell the end of the human race\".[213] Philosopher Nick Bostrom argues that sufficiently intelligent AI, if it chooses actions based on achieving some goal, will exhibit convergent behavior such as acquiring resources or protecting itself from being shut down. If this AI\\'s goals do not fully reflect humanity\\'s, it might need to harm humanity to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, ultimately to better achieve its goal. He concludes that AI poses a risk to mankind, however humble or \"friendly\" its stated goals might be.[214]\\nPolitical scientist Charles T. Rubin argues that \"any sufficiently advanced benevolence may be indistinguishable from malevolence.\" Humans should not assume machines or robots would treat us favorably because there is no a priori reason to believe that they would share our system of morality.[215]\\nThe opinion of experts and industry insiders is mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superhumanly-capable AI.[216]\\nStephen Hawking, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, history professor Yuval Noah Harari, and SpaceX founder Elon Musk have all expressed serious misgivings about the future of AI.[217]\\nProminent tech titans including Peter Thiel (Amazon Web Services) and Musk have committed more than $1\\xa0billion to nonprofit companies that champion responsible AI development, such as OpenAI and the Future of Life Institute.[218]\\nMark Zuckerberg (CEO, Facebook) has said that artificial intelligence is helpful in its current form and will continue to assist humans.[219]\\nOther experts argue is that the risks are far enough in the future to not be worth researching,\\nor that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.[220]\\nRodney Brooks, in particular, has said that \"malevolent\" AI is still centuries away.[u]\\nAI\\'s decisions making abilities raises the questions of legal responsibility and copyright status of created works. This issues are being refined in various jurisdictions.[222] However, criticism has been raised about whether and to what extent the works created with the assistance of AI are under the protection of copyright laws.[223]\\nFriendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.[224]\\nMachines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.[225]\\nMachine ethics is also called machine morality, computational ethics or computational morality,[225]\\nand was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005.[226]\\nOther approaches include Wendell Wallach\\'s \"artificial moral agents\"[227]\\nand Stuart J. Russell\\'s three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.[228]\\nThe regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating artificial intelligence (AI); it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.[229]\\nThe regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.[230]\\nBetween 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.[45]\\nMost EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, US and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.[45]\\nThe Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology.[45] Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.[231]\\nThought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,[16]\\nand have been a persistent theme in science fiction.[18]\\nA common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley\\'s Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke\\'s and Stanley Kubrick\\'s 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.[232]\\nIsaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many books and stories, most notably the \"Multivac\" series about a super-intelligent computer of the same name. Asimov\\'s laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;[233]\\nwhile almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov\\'s laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.[234]\\nTranshumanism (the merging of humans and machines) is explored in the manga Ghost in the Shell and the science-fiction series Dune.\\nSeveral works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek\\'s R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.[235]\\nThese were the four the most widely used AI textbooks in 2008:\\nLater editions.\\nThe two most widely used textbooks in 2021.Open Syllabus: Explorer Archived 7 October 2021 at the Wayback Machine\\n'"
